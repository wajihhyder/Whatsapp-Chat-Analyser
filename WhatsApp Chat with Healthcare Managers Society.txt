_*Breaking News from CNN :-*_

*Dr. Li Wenliang*, China's hero doctor who was punished for telling the truth about Corona Virus and later died due to the same disease, had documented casefiles for research purposes and had in the casefiles proposed a cure that would significantly decrease the impact of the COVID - 19 Virus on the human body. The chemical *Methylxanthine*, *Theobromine* and *Theophylline* stimulate compounds that can ward off these virus in a human with atleast an average immune system. Whats more shocking is that these complex words that were so difficult for people in China to understand is actually called *Tea* in India, YES, our regular Tea has all these chemicals already in it. The main Methylxanthine in tea is the stimulant caffeine. Other Methylxanthines found in tea are two chemically similar compounds, Theobromine and Theophylline. The tea plant creates these chemicals as a way to ward off insects and other animals. Who would have known that all the solution to these virus would be a simple cup of TEA. and that is the reason so many patients in China are being cured. The hospital staff in china has started serving tea to the patients 3 times a day, And the effect is finally in *Wuhan* "The centre of this Pandemic" has been contained and community transmission has almost stopped.

Please Share this message to your friends and family to make them aware about this blessing in the form of TEA in your kitchen.

Ya Allah, I depend on you alone. I have no power of my own. When things and times are going well for me, I know they have come from you and that I have no power of my own. In my trials, I rely on you. In my temptations and tribulations, I trust in you. My success and temporary failure are all in your hands and so is my soul. I have no power of my own. Ya Jabaar, Ya Kareem, Ya Malik, Ya Ghaffar, Al-Wadud, Ya Azeez, Ya Latif, I cannot do and live without your Rahama. Save me from all evils, guide my going out and coming in, this moment, today and until the day you have destined for me to die. Ameen. 

This prayer is In Shaa Allah so powerful. Pass it to as many people as you can. You will be astound to know how many people are in critical need of this prayer.

Please do not break the chain even if you can. This might be a test.
If Allah comes first in your life and HE is *ALL* you *DEPEND ON,* then stop whatever you are doing this minute and send it to more people. Failure to share this message attracts no consequences. Not at all.
Just do it with *FAITH* and your *LOVE* for humanity!
 *Asalamu Alaykum.*

آغا خان ہاسپٹل  کے کرونا ٹیسٹ کے نتائج پر سوالات کھڑے ہو گئے ۔

17مارچ کو محمد حنیف  طبیعت خراب ہونے کی وجہ   آغا خان ہاسپٹل سے کرونا ٹیسٹ کروایا۔ 

18 مارچ کو رپورٹ لینے گیا تو ہاسپٹل انتظامیہ نے بولا کے آپکا ٹیسٹ پازٹیو آیا ہے ۔ متاثرہ شخص کا بیان 

اسی وقت ہاسپٹل انتظامیہ نے مجھے داخل کر لیا اور علاج کے لئیے 6 لاکھ جمع کروانے کا بولا۔ محمد حنیف 

میں نے اس وقت 50 ہزار روپے جمع کروائے اور مجھے پرائیویٹ ونگ 3 کے کمرہ 331 میں ایڈمٹ کر لیا گیا ۔ 

ڈاکٹرز نے مجھے بولاکے آپکو کرونا وائیرس ہے جسکی ابھی کوئی میڈیسن تیار نہیں ہوئی آپکو 14 دن کے لئیے ایڈمٹ کر رہے ہیں ۔ 

یہ بات سن کر میں اور میری فیملی شدید پریشان ہو گئی ۔ محمد حنیف کا بیان ۔

19 مارچ کو ڈاکٹرز سے گھر میں قرنطینہ ہونے کی اجازت لے کر گھر آگیا۔ 

دوستوں اور فیملی کے مشورے سے اپنے آبائی شہر پنجاب چلا گیا ۔ 

اپنا شک دور کرنے کے لئیے21 مارچکو  لاہور کے ڈاکٹرز ہاسپٹل سے دوبارہ کرونا کا ٹیسٹ کروایا۔ 

لاہور کے ڈاکٹرز ہاسپٹل کی رپورٹ کے مطابق مجھے کبھی بھی کرونا کی شکائیت نہیں ہوئی ۔ 

آغا خان ہاسپٹل کی لیبارٹری کی غلط تشخیص سے مجھے اور میری فیملی کو 3دن شدید زہنی ، جسمانی اذیت اٹھانہ پڑی 

اعلی حکام سے اپیل ہے کہ آغا خان ہاپسپٹل انتظامیہ کے خلاف سخت کاروائی کی جائے اور مزید لوگوں کی زندگیوں کو بچایا جائے ۔

30/03/2020, 11:58 am - +92 344 2663311: FDA ISSUES EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION OF ANTI MALARIA DRUG FOR CORONAVIRUS CARE.  

No data supporting this decision was presented in the news report:

"The agency allowed for the drugs to be "donated to the Strategic National Stockpile to be distributed and prescribed by doctors to hospitalized teen and adult patients with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible," HHS said in a statement, announcing that Sandoz donated 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to the stockpile and Bayer donated 1 million doses of chloroquine."

03/04/2020, 11:25 am - +92 313 2402216: TRAFFIC is gone, LONG QUEUES are gone.

FUEL is affordable, BILLS extended.

KIDS are at home with their FAMILIES, PARENTS are home taking care of their CHILDREN.

FAST FOOD replaced by HOME COOKED MEALS, hectic SCHEDULES replaced by NAPS.

The AIR seems CLEANER, the WORLD QUIETER.

PEOPLE are conscious about HYGIENE and HEALTH again.

MONEY doesn't seem to make the WORLD GO ROUND anymore.

And WE now have TIME, finally, to STOP and SMELL the ROSES.

It seems like this COVID-19 is a RESET BUTTON for HUMANITY!!!

Use this opportunity to sit back and reflect on how we can repay mother earth whilst making effective changes.

Say: O ALLAH, change the situation and our condition to  

Say: O ALLAH, turn our hearts, fix our hearts on Your path,

Say: O ALLAH, our hope in You will not be lost,
The cloud of misery will be gone, and our condition will be changed,
Praise be to You for Your generosity.

 

Remember ALLAH, may ALLAH have mercy on you.

 Spend more the 2 hours in ambulance looking for icu bed used all connection then eventually brought dead at OJHA. I feel sorry tht a physician who served this city and country for many years couldnt get hold of hospital bed in his last moments. 

It’s really sad but true. He died of Covid.

09/06/2020, 5:43 pm - +92 334 7328020: *انور مقصود کی پوسٹ انجوئے کریں*

تبدیلی کا سفر"ایاك نعبد واياك نستعين" سے شروع ہوا " انا الله مع الصابرين" سے ہوتا ہوا "انا للله وانا اليه راجعون" کی طرف گامزن ھے.

کیا “ سلیکٹرز “(امپائرز) کوئی شرمندگی محسُوس کررہے ہیں یا “چیف سلیکٹر“ ابھی تک اپنی  پراڈکٹ پہ نازاں ہیں ؟ 

اس تباہی و بربادی کی ذمہ دار حکُومت ہے یا “سلیکشن کمیٹی”؟ 

پاکستانیوں کو مدینے  کا ٹکٹ دکھا کر کُوفے میں دھکیل دیا گیا ہے۔ 

پی ٹی آئی کو حکومت اگر 1947 میں بھی مل جاتی تب بھی اُنہوں نے یہی رونا تھا کہ انگریز پورا ملک تباہ کر گیا ہے۔

سروے کے مطابق عمران خان کو تمام ترقیاتی پروجیکٹ اور بیویاں ایسی ملیں جن کا افتتاح پہلے سے ہی کوئی کر چکا تھا۔

تبدیلی کا کیڑا اب صرف ان لوگوں میں زندہ  ہے جن کا جیب خرچ ابھی تک والدین یا محلے والے اٹھا رہے ہیں۔ 

تبدیلی لوٹوں سے شروع ہوئی ہالینڈ کی سائیکل سے ہوتی ہوئی انڈوں، مرغیوں، کٹوں اور پھر IMF کی خودکشی تک پہنچ چکی ہے مزید پیش قدمی جاری ہے۔

مجهے اللہ سے قوی امید ہے کہ جو مسلمان پی ٹی آئی کے فتنے سے بچ گیا وہ دجال کے فتنے سے بھی بچےگا ان شاءاللہ.

پی ٹی آئ والوں  سے بحث کرکے اپنا وقت ضائع نہ کریں یہ صرف آپ کے سامنے ڈٹے ہوتے ہیں۔ اکیلے میں یہ بھی حسن نثارکی طرح خود پرلعنت بھیجتے ہیں. 

ماہرین کا کہنا ہے پی ٹی آٸ والوں سے بحث مت کریں اس کا اندازہ فیصل واڈا سے لگایا جا سکتا ہے۔

عمران نیازی خود تو سائیکل پر دفتر نہ جاسکے لیکن عوام کو سائیکل چلانے پر مجبور کردیا. 

روز جو 12 ارب کرپشن ہوتی تھی کیا اب بھی ہورہی ہے؟
اگر نہیں تو آٹھ ماہ میں 2880 ارب روپے جمع ہوچکے ہیں وہ کہاں گئے؟

 اختلاف اپنی جگہ لیکن یہ بات ماننی پڑے گی کہ عمران خان واقعی غریبوں کے لیے فرشتہ بن کر سامنے آیا ہے۔

وہ بھی موت کا۔

13/08/2020, 3:48 pm - +92 342 5264195: Assalam o alaikum Respected Faculty 
I am Dr Noor from Batch 4. I had my GAT exam today i wanted to give feedback regarding it and anyone is free to disagree. 
1. Time: the time was standard 2 hours BUT the type of questions that it had took time to solve. 
Eg. English comprehension was too long after every question used to take 5 mins to read for a answer that is easy. Very very lenghthy questions 
2. Timer on the portal: portal clock was decieving and me being so engrossed in the exam relied on it and still at approx 15 questions to solve when the paper. 
Yes i agree i should have checked the watch too but it can happen to anyone.
3. The english part: questions were very badly made and it made me question my own english. Clossed passages questions were very confusing and nothing for understandable. 
4. Lag: it took nearly a min to skip from one question to another. 
5. Few questions had no correct answer or options in it. 
Overall it was a traumatic experience 😅 
Anyone is free to add anything in it
13/08/2020, 3:48 pm - +92 336 1222613: Time was insufficient and Question were so confusing
13/08/2020, 3:51 pm - +92 344 2663311: Thank You
Was typing the same thing.

There were long cases with different questions. We have to read it every time it appeared as it was not in sequence.

We did not had option to go back once the ans has been given.
13/08/2020, 3:52 pm - +92 312 2925513: Questions specially (English part )were not clear and unable to allign with options. Time was insufficient.
13/08/2020, 3:54 pm - +92 344 2663311: I couldn’t even skip one question which i though I would be solving in the end.
13/08/2020, 3:56 pm - +92 342 5264195: Yes this took time too. The option of not going back and solving the question because you have no choice.
13/08/2020, 3:58 pm - +92 345 3440087: Considering that the portal is having teething issues, the time should have been more to cope up and overcome them
13/08/2020, 3:59 pm - +92 344 2663311: If someone had internet connectivity issue. There was no support or instruction given.

13/08/2020, 4:10 pm - Madia MHM: Mainly our time was wasted due to No skip option...
13/08/2020, 4:11 pm - +92 337 0391942: And whoever started late should also calculate from that point because I came on time but I did not take the practice test so there was a problem in login and resolving but time wasted.
And the questions were very long and difficult
13/08/2020, 4:16 pm - +92 300 9370231: Dr Noor's feed back is 💯 true same was with me
13/08/2020, 5:31 pm - Ruby Shabbir: Strongly agree with Noor's comments
13/08/2020, 5:31 pm - Dr Fehmina: 100% agreed to it... Idk if anyone else faced this problem or not but it was taking time in loading another question. Initially I didn't get the closed question as it made no sense to me and later I understood what the were asking to I was selfdoubting regarding English. Then comes the passage part, I had to read the passage again n again when I appeared, the relevant questions could have been asked underneath for better understanding and time management.

•If you see me leaving this group, please add me again. It's just that I’m so desperate to go out!

•Never in my wildest dreams have I imagined myself entering a bank, wearing a mask, and asking for money.

•Never thought my hands would one day consume more alcohol than my liver...ever!

•Quarantine seems like a Netflix series: just when you think it's over, they release the next season.

•I’m starting to like this mask thing. I went to the supermarket yesterday and two people that I owe money to didn’t recognize me. 

•Those complaining 2020 didn’t have enough holidays, what now?!

•I need to social distance myself from my fridge; I tested positive for excess weight!

•Could someone tell me if the second quarantine would be with the same family or we get to exchange?

•I’m not planning on adding 2020 to my age. I didn’t even use it!

•We want to publicly apologize to the year 2019 for all the bad things we said about it. 

•To all the ladies who were praying for their husbands to spend more time with them, how are you doing? 

•My washing machine only accepts pyjamas these days. I put in a pair of jeans and a message popped up : “Stay Home!”

•If I see anyone crying on 31st December over the year coming to an end, I would personally smash a bottle on their head!

•After all that we have been through right now, the only thing missing would be the vaccine getting released in suppository form. 

•I feel like a teenager all year long: no money in the wallet, hair long and out of control, thinking what to do with my life, and grounded at home.

19/10/2020, 10:48 pm - +92 333 3403522: Isn’t this forum for general announcements that are for all batches
19/10/2020, 10:49 pm - +92 321 2251918: Dr saima they are asking about employee engagement assignements and midterm and we dont have any watsapp group for this particular course more over students from all the batches are enrolled in EE that is why we discuss EE here
19/10/2020, 10:49 pm - +92 321 2251918: I hope i made it clear.
19/10/2020, 10:50 pm - +92 333 3403522: Yes Nisha u did :) but what I said wasn’t particularly for this post..
19/10/2020, 10:50 pm - +92 321 2251918: guys assignment is due before midterm 
Midterm s most probable date is 6th nov inshallah . So u got to submit before 30th oct

Your batch too
19/10/2020, 10:50 pm - +92 333 3920444: Thank u dear
19/10/2020, 10:51 pm - +92 333 3403522: Also why don’t u make a group for employee engagement since ALOT of us aren’t taking this course.
19/10/2020, 10:51 pm - +92 333 0263696: eeee
19/10/2020, 10:51 pm - +92 333 6571330: okay dr nisha thank you, EE and Gat are general issues of all batches thats why we discussed here
19/10/2020, 10:52 pm - +92 333 3403522: Akhtar 👆🏻
19/10/2020, 10:52 pm - +92 321 2251918: I cant do it Because sir sabir😊
He prefers fb over watsapp and i am not allowed to make any group without his permission.
19/10/2020, 10:54 pm - +92 333 3403522: Not with him- with all the ppl taking this course- jaisay yahan baatein hoti hain pertaining to the class timings, availability etc to woh Wahan ker lain :)
19/10/2020, 10:54 pm - +92 321 2251918: Isi ka naam change krdaiti hn
19/10/2020, 10:54 pm - +92 321 2251918: Much easier🤣
19/10/2020, 10:54 pm - +92 333 3403522: Doesn’t solve the issue Nisha :)
19/10/2020, 10:57 pm - +92 321 2251918: Honestly i ve no brain to manage another group 
All the announcements which are made on fb are made here again repetitively because of the students of other batches not ours 
We also did HR with sir sabir and we had only fb grp 
This is the other students who ask questns on watsapp not on fb grp 
I m managing fb 
Cant manage watsap for this course 
And yes i do try to share things here . 
Sorry if anyone is in trouble because of this but it is what it is cant help it much 
Love you dr saima for your patience❤️

19/10/2020, 11:04 pm - +92 333 3403522: U post here or on another group? How is that different? 
I really don’t see how that is different.. 
I put my point across Baqi it’s up to u to realize if its an inconvenience for the several others who are not taking this course!
19/10/2020, 11:10 pm - +92 312 2925513: Yes 🙏
19/10/2020, 11:11 pm - +92 345 2003237: Dr Nisha is doing a great job in managing the multi batched group of EE 
It’s only fair that others get bothered with questions not relevant to all the batches ; EE or otherwise . 

This group should be restricted only for general announcements by Dr Farah 

Next time onwards no questions regarding EE  or any other thing which is not prevalent to ALL the groups should be posted here, 

Thank you

19/10/2020, 11:18 pm - +92 333 3403522: The only reason I said it is because guys see what happens is when u message here for ur EE class u guys leave literally loads of messages including class kub hai, class join naheen horahee, send the class link and more. And when we open the group we have to go through literally hundreds of messages to screen so that we don’t miss anything important from dr farah. 

So please don’t take this personally- we have been going through all the courses too and ALI our CR has always managed to keep a separate group for every single course! 
Ana ab good night .. sleep well all of u

WHY?

1. Victoria's Secret declared bankruptcy.

12. Even Starbucks also announced to permanently close their 400 stores.
13. WeWork isn't in a great spot either

The list goes on & on

See the US economy landscape :

Nissan Motor Co. may close down in USA

1. Biggest Car Rental company (Hertz) filed for bankruptcy - they also own Thrifty and Dollar
2. Biggest Trucking company (Comcar) filed for bankruptcy - they have 4000 trucks

4. Biggest investor in the world (Warren Buffet) lost $50B in the last 2 months
5. Biggest investment company in the world (BlackRock) is signalling disaster in the world economy - they manage over $7 Trillion
6. Biggest mall in America (Mall of America) stopped paying mortgage payments
7. Most reputable airline in the world (Emirates) laying off 30% of its employees
8. US Treasury printing trillions to try to keep the economy on life support
9. Estimated no. of retail stores closing in 2020 - 12,000 to 15,000. The following are big retailers that have announced closing:

- J. Crew

- Victoria's Secret
- Bath & Body Works
- Forever 21

and many many more

Unemployment claims reached an all-time high of 38+ million - unemployment is over 25% (out of 160 million of work force, close to 40 million are jobless). With no income, consumer demand is falling drastically and the economy will go into a free fall. This is just USA...

Under the weight of the new crown pandemic, many giants are facing the crisis of failure. 5 months of pandemic created a LOT of debt, and tens of thousands of companies went bankrupt. If you have business & your company is still there, and there are no pay cuts or layoffs, pl treat your company & customer well. Humans are facing the pandemic that cannot be controlled. The second half of 2020, is the challenge of corporate strength & relationship

How is PAKISTAN going to tackle the chain reaction which may reach us any moment

10/11/2020, 4:45 pm - +92 335 2894457: It is not like that ke people are not attending classes. I had a genuine reason and it does not mean that if i missed one class, i won't get to know such big announcements.  And i don't need to ask my mates for such big events like midterm exam. Midterm exams should be told and announced very clearly at least one week before at all forums. Please do not take it personal. Keep yourself in my place and then think
10/11/2020, 4:46 pm - +92 335 2894457: Midterm exam is not just a happening of class that one need to ask the mates
10/11/2020, 4:47 pm - +92 335 2894457: Anyways sorry if you got bothered

12/11/2020, 5:04 pm - Dr Farha: A note from Shabbar Zaidi. ( Former chairman FBR)

Dear All. 

When I look at the declared wealth of MNAs in newspaper today I thought that I wasted by life as far as earning is concerned. 

I remained a Partner of the largest accounting firm from 1995 to 2014. And Senior Partner from 2014 to 2019. The firm was the largest taxpayer accounting firm in the country. Our
next was almost half of us in taxes. 

My father was an ‘Actuary’ and the grandfather was an ICS. My maternal grandfather was PM of State of Bharatpur (Rajputana) 

I do not understand why my forefathers opted for Pakistan. I think it was a ‘mission’ of my grandfather not a logical and rational decision. But that is history. 

I served as Chairman FBR and miserably failed. Pro bono. I was given every honour that can be given by this country. But my economics failed in relation to other ‘respectable’ person in this country. 

Without knowing the details I feel that this country can never be better in this state of affairs. 

All corruptions are intrinsically personal. Wealth Statement is the test. 

I can assure that actual personal taxes by all the billionaire MNAs will be less definitely less than mine. But my net wealth is less than one tenth or twentieth of the lowest . 

They know some ‘tax planning’ which I do not understand. 

It is state sponsored corruption. 

No one is to be blamed. I was given a chance but I failed. No complaint. 

Nevertheless I am satisfied. I am answerable to Almighty as I have fulfilled His commands but not answerable to fellow human beings as in this case I tried my best. I hope I will be comfortable in my grave. I don’t know about Heaven or Hell. But the grave is a reality. 
ہر داغ ھے اس دل مین بجر داغ ندامت

My suggestion for correction is not any more think tank or committees. 

It is more and more information to public at large. Society if well informed is always very ruthless whilst dealing with its interest. 

This is not a personal story. 

This is the reason of immigration of talent amongst upper middle class who do not happen to own land. Be it Jati Umra or Rato Dero. Be it a Sindhi or Punjabi speaking. 

When one generation makes a mistake the following suffers. We will not repeat the history. Now rights will be snatched if not voluntarily provided. This is another lesson of history. It is only a matter of time. I pray it to be bloodless. A case study.

07/01/2021, 10:51 pm - Dr Farha: Tapping with a hammer……$ 2.00
Knowing where to tap………$ 9,998.00

this is how the story goes...

A giant ship engine failed. 
The ship’s owners tried one expert after another, but none of them could figure but how to fix the engine.

Then they brought in an old man who had been fixing ships since he was a young.

He carried a large bag of tools with him, and when he arrived, he immediately went to work. He inspected the engine very carefully, top to bottom.
 
Two of the ship’s owners were there, watching this man, hoping he would know what to do.

After looking things over, the old man reached into his bag and pulled out a small hammer. He gently tapped something.

Instantly, the engine lurched into life. He carefully put his hammer away. The engine was fixed!

A week later, the owners received a bill from the old man for ten thousand dollars.

“What?!” the owners exclaimed. “He hardly did anything!”

So they wrote the old man a note saying, “Please send us an itemized bill.”

The man sent a bill that read:

Tapping with a hammer……$ 2.00
Knowing where to tap………$ 9,998.00

Effort is important, but knowing where to make an effort makes all the difference!

05/02/2021, 7:44 pm - Dr Farha: My Experience with COVID WARD of South City Hospital

On 11th December 2020, my father Dr. Capt. Aslam Shah was taken into the Emergency Room (“ER”) of South City Hospital COVID Ward and was admitted in ICU after 7 hours of wait in the ER. He was hospitalized for 40 days out of which 10 days he was on oxygen support/Bipap and remaining 30 days he was on the ventilator. Initially he suffered from COVID pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ("ARDS"), later he acquired ICU bacterial infections twice and almost suffered from severe septicemia and sceptic shock twice. Finally, he went into coma due to hypoxia (lack of oxygen in brain) and expired after 40 TORTURTIOUS DAYS in this hospital.

DR. NASIR KHOSO was assigned as my fathers consultant who is also the Head of Critical Care Unit (“CCU”) of South City Covid Ward.
Not to forget there are only 4 consultants in CCU COVID WARD of South City. Each consultant has been assigned approximately 70-90 patients. Every Consultant gives around 10-15 minutes each day to every patient in the CCU suffering from COVID.

What went WRONG?

1. DR. NASIR KHOSO FAILED to diagnose my father with ARDS and failed to inform us until after 2 weeks of his admission.

2. DR. NASIR KHOSO blatantly REFUSED to get culture report of my father in the first 20 days of his admission. It was refused and denied even upon our repeated insistence (we have documentary evidence of that) failure of which caused my father to be attacked by nasty bacterias in his body, due to which he went in sceptic shock which IF had been treated on time he would NOT have been on the ventilator at all. Dr. Nasir Khoso didn't even think twice before checking and ruling out the possibility that his oxygen pressures were dropping due to not just COVID but also ICU related bacterial infection in his body which were eating his lungs.

3. My father was kept in the ER for 7 hours only on oxygen without any treatment. He was taken to the ICU after 7 hours and was given remdesiver after 24 hours of his admission. 

4. We were not given any WRITTEN medical opinion/record till the end irrespective of our repeated request.

5. Dr. Nasir failed to take on board any cardiologist, hematologist, pulmonologist and refused to get any cardio report, which caused his BNP to rise upto 5,500.

6. My father was losing blood, his hemoglobin dropped from 12.8 to 6 and Dr. Nasir Khoso failed to find any evidence for this sudden loss of blood.

7. Dr. Nasir Khoso informed me and my brother that my father has 5% chance of survival in the 1st week of his stay, this was when he was NOT intubated. It was clearly based on no evidentiary value not even clinical value (2 male witnesses were already present at that time).

8. My father was given acuron (paraylizing agent) for continuous 28 days without any sedation break when he was intubated. All thanks to DR. NASIR KHOSO.

9. Day to day counselling was NOT confidential and was NOT given in a proper set up, it was done in the hallway of South City which was conducted in front of guards, receptionist and other attendants. 

10. Front desk’s employees’ behavior was extremely uncooperative, abusive and inefficient. We had to bribe and give unlimited money every day to the watch man, guards and nurses to call us and inform when the doctor will arrive for counselling. Apparently, this is a job of the hospital to inform each attendant their counselling time. Additionally, Dr. Nasir Khoso never arrived on his given time and I had to leave my job for 2 months just to stay in the hospital for 10-12 hours every day. 

11. As per medical ethics there is a proper method/procedure to break bad news but unfortunately Dr. Nasir Khoso told us publicly standing in front of nurses, staff, receptionist, guards, watchman that “your father is not going to wake up this time” in an agitated, irritated, annoyed, infuriated and in a threatening manner. 

12. Dr. Nasir Khoso shouted on me and my sister –in-law raising his finger “if we keep asking him any further questions about my father he will NOT treat our patient”, we were being blackmailed (this incident took place in front of atleast 10 people)

13. Covid ward and non covid ward have no interconnection within the building, due to which my father was unable to get his lungs CT, brain CT and shifting to NON-COVID Ward from COVID Ward was IMPOSSIBLE even though he was PCR negative (we have 3 negative PCR reports).

14. South City does not have a team/panel of doctors for such critical patients, only one consultant checks every patient without any intervention from a cardiologist, pulmologist, hematologist including a psychiatrist which was EXTREMELY important after steroid induced psychosis which almost every patient was suffering in COVID ICU and they refused to take a psychiatrist on board for my father even after our repeated request.

15. There was no proper counselling time, we used to wait in queue since 9 am till 6pm and sometimes later till 8 pm for Dr. Nasir Khoso to arrive and update us about our father’s condition and this was a regular practice. 

16. There is no app where we can view reports, x-rays. Reports were being collected physically every day and there was a long queue.

17. Proper protection for COVID was not taken, doctors, nurses were wearing same scrubs, shoe covers and going on the roads and dealing with patients in non-covid ward. Head of nursing ER COVID Ward takes tobacco, gutka in his mouth during his duty hours. Globally, as per medical ethics and rules an addict is not allowed to work in such a critical area.

18. Response team of South City Hospital is EXTREMELY weak and inefficient, for example they do not know and are not trained to carry out proper CPR in ER where a patient died in front of my eyes.

19. At 4 am when we were there to collect my father’s body they refused to accept cheque. Apparently only CASH and Pay Order is acceptable. I don’t understand at such ungodly hours how can anyone carry cash when banks are closed.

Therefore, I would humbly request Pakistan Medical & Dental Council and Government of Pakistan to investigate into the aforementioned concerns and look into these UNPROFESSIONAL, IRRESPONSIBLE, INEFFICIENT practices of South City Hospital and Dr. Nasir Khoso should also be individually held accountable for his negligence and actions. 

IF ANYONE OF YOU THINK IM BIASED AGAINST THE HOSPITAL, let me clear this out, Dr. Jawaid Hussain and Dr. Madeeha Masrur both were looking into my father last 14 days, although my father couldn’t survive but undoubtedly Dr. Jawaid and Dr. Madeeha are EXTREMELY OUTSTANDNING doctors and I have non complaints against them.

Can someone please tell us who is responsible for our loss which we suffered as a direct result of the negligent treatment of South City Hospital and DR. NASIR KHOSO? This will include:

• Death of my father
• compensation for pain and suffering 
• payment for ongoing treatment for 40 days
• compensation for the loss of my job for the past 2 months
• loss of earnings 
• cost of extra money given to staff and guards
• compensation for psychological damage.

A lot of people who were Frontliners and had covid ne imaandari se us waqt register bhi nahi karwaya register since they are not advised to do so before 90 days. And when they could get the vaccine,  the registration process was closed up without announcing any deadline whatsoever. A lot of Frontliners and doctors got left out.

In a shocking new report on the COVID-19 vaccines, it has been discovered that the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine may have long term health effects not previously disclosed, including “ALS, Alzheimer’s, and other neurological degenerative diseases.”

“The current RNA based SARSCoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long term safety testing,” the report declares.

“In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients.” Prion-based diseases are, according to the CDC, a form of neurodegenerative diseases, meaning that the Pfizer vaccine is potentially likely to cause long term damage and negative health effects with regards to the brain.

This is especially concerning since the Pfizer vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, an untested type of vaccine which creates new proteins and can actually integrate into the human genome, according to a report from the National Library of Medicine.

In other words, degenerative brain conditions may appear at any time in your life after receiving the vaccine.

“The RNA sequence of the vaccine as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations,” explains the report. TDP-43 is a protein known to cause dementia, ALS and even Alzheimer’s, according to Alzpedia. Similarly, the FUS protein is known to cause ALS and Hereditary Essential Tremors, according to the Human Genome Database.

The experiment done for the report was to determine whether or not these two harmful proteins embed themselves into our DNA, as an mRNA vaccine is expected to do. The report determined that “the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations,” meaning that both proteins have the potential to embed themselves into our DNA and cause harmful neurological diseases.

The report’s abstract summary concludes that

“The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.” The report itself ends with this warning: 

"The vaccine could be a bioweapon and even more dangerous than the original infection.”

National File actually reached out to the CDC to inquire as to why the Pfizer vaccine is still being distributed despite these credible allegations. No response was received prior to publication.

اسکے لیے کسی کی سفارش کی ضرورت نہیں ۔

بُزرگوں کا مشاہدہ ہے کہ انفاق انسان کے وسائل میں برکت ڈال دیتا ہے۔ جیسے جیسے وہ خدا کے راستے میں خرچ کرتا جاتا ہے، اس کا خزانہ بڑھتا چلا جاتا ہے۔ یہ اس دنیا کا قصہ ہے۔ ورنہ آخرت کا معاملہ تو الگ ہے کہ وہ اجر ہمارے حساب کتاب کے دائرے سے باہر ہے۔ خدا کے ساتھ یہ تجارت کیسی منافع بخش ہے کہ انسان اس دنیا میں نوازا جاتا ہے اور آخرت میں بھی۔ اس کو قرآن بہترین تجارت کہتا ہے

*اے مالک کوں و مکاں، ہمیں اس بہتریں تجارت کا تاجر بنادے کہ جس میں منافع کاحساب کتاب آخرت میں ہی ہو*

31/05/2021, 7:43 pm - Dr Farha: I have a job opening for a health reporter at SAMAA Digital. I thought I'd ask you just in case you know of any young person. 
It is an ideal job for someone with an MBBS, biological sciences, DPharm background who does not want to practice. 
Karachi newsroom. 
Pay starting at 50k if you have no journalism experience but is negotiable depending on the background/profile. 
We do health explainer videos and reporting which involves making calls and going into the field to report on health news. Some statistics and graph making is involved, so there is a data component, esp given Covid. 
Anyone interested can contact me, Mahim Maher, the editor of SAMAA TV digital at mahim.maher@samaa.tv To see what work has been done visit: https://www.facebook.com/healthsamaa

22/07/2021, 8:25 pm - Ruby Shabbir: I never had the privilege to meet 27 years old Noor Mukadam but those who knew her have described her as a woman who always had a smile, a kind word and a pleasantry to pass on. But even if she wasn’t a nice person, what happened to her can not be described as anything less than barbaric. 

The basic facts are as follows: Noor and Zahir were childhood friends and their families knew each other. Noor had gone to visit Zahir Jaffer  at his house on Chand Raat because he was leaving for the United States to pursue his Masters a day later. On Tuesday 19th July while we were all busy applying henna on our hands or ironing Eid clothes, Noor’s father (a former Pakistan ambassador) received a phone call that I pray no dad ever has to receive. The Kohsar Police Station was urgently summoning him. 

The police officers took him to Zahir’s house in F 7/4, an address Shaukat Mukadam knew well since his family had been known to the Jaffers for years. Inside the floor was covered in blood and in a corner his daughter lay lifeless, her head chopped off and threw in a separate corner. Forensics confirmed that Noor had first been shot and then beheaded. When the poor girl was screaming, servants and even Zakir’s younger sister heard her and immediately called the police but by the time they arrived the crime had been committed. 

You know what is heart wrenching and gut churning and just plain shocking! That the father who had to see his 27 year old daughter’s body chopped up, has no time to grieve. The family is being given no time to weep and hug and console each other. The murderer’s side is influential and without even waiting for Noor’s burial, began putting pressure on the victims to accept blood money. The main focus of the Jaffers is to somehow get their dual citizen son out of the country so he can be free or go for rehabilitation or counselling or whatever. 

No where in the world would the family of the victim of such a barbaric crime be made to go through the torture of knocking on doors to just ensure that the murderer doesn’t flee. 

I honestly don’t give a damn about how deep the pockets of the Jaffers are and how influential they are! If they had the money, they should have gotten their son off drugs and into rehabilitation and counselling years ago. They should also have ensured their violent and unpredictable son was never alone with other people. They should have not allowed guns and knives and what not in his possession. Apparently the murderer had guards for his protection flailing his every move! Well, how about hiring guards to protect those he came in contact with. 

Anyways the claims of mental instability of the murderer are nothing short of rubbish. If he was mentally unstable, why was he allowed to roam freely in the capital city and host parties? If he was so violent, why was he appointed the chief brand strategist of his father’s empire? If he was so unpredictable, why was he heading for a Masters, hosting parties and even going to schools to give counselling sessions. 

Poor parenting! A shocking and vulgar belief that money and influence can help their son go scotfree. A complete lack of humanity on the part of Jaffers! Instead of offering their son up for a trial and life imprisonment, they are hustling up favours to get him out of Pakistan. 

Noor’s father has sworn to fight for justice for his daughter till his dying breath. I swear too that I will do what I can to ensure the barbaric and violent murderer of this young girl doesn’t escape. Please all of you reading this, raise your voice. The Jaffers may have silenced mainstream media but show them and the world that they will not silence the Ammis of Pakistan. Let’s fight for Noor because a fight for her is a fight for our daughters! For ourselves! For our sisters! What if tomorrow one of our daughters is BEHEADED by a monster and we are offered blood money to let him flee???? Think of that eventuality and raise your voice. Do it NOW! If the murderer leaves Islamabad, you and I have all failed!!! And God forbid, our daughters pay the price!

Stop the Jaffers now! There is no other choice that we have if we want to make sure our daughters stay safe!!!

02/08/2021, 1:02 pm - +92 344 2663311: So,
Apparently we are responsible for our own health if we get adverse event. What should be done now? Pt is 66 years old male with mild HTH. Had nose and mouth bleeding with in 24hrs of sinovac vaccine.
02/08/2021, 1:03 pm - +92 344 2663311: This statement was given by one of a doctor in dho office.

02/08/2021, 2:11 pm - +92 344 2663311: I think there is a under reporting on adverse events. The patient is doing well but I am literally worried about masses. One can easily say that rumours heard about vaccines are not completely wrong as well.

04/08/2021, 5:54 am - +92 333 0263696: AoA was in need of some direction. Can a doctor file a complaint for covid positivity if, after two positive results (5 to 7 days apart) and being clinically sick, the hospital asks them to join duty and undergo a third test from their hospital lab? ( this is a government hospital) The sick  individual from day one of his/her first covid report submission has been contacted everyday and mentally tortured to come and do duties or come and provide the sample. Where is it permissible for a contagious person to travel freely and spread the disease? The patient, who is in excruciating pain and losing saturation most of the time, isolates himself at home and receiving treatment from co-doctors so that one bed can be saved for someone who is unable to care for themselves. Could any of you please tell me if there is a legislation prohibiting hospital officials from acting in this manner? In the midst of a pandemic, doctors are continually plagued by calls and messages, even while they (doctors) are falling sick.  Please let me know if there is any appropriate authority that will take action in this regard . Because we  (doctors) are humans we have sick family members and we, too, become ill and  deserve to fully recover without being tortured like this. 
koi wakai kuch ker skta hai tou let me know.

I needed guidance about something vaccination related, if anyone can help
I had my grandmother vaccinated from Dow Dental back in April. They had just started single dose CanSino back then so we decided on getting her that. Process went smoothly and she got her vaccination card with CanSino written on it. 
However the online 1166 record had been updated for first dose Sinopharm and hence her vaccination is still being reflected as incomplete and her NADRA vaccination certificate is not available for downloading.
Can anyone help regarding this?
1166 helpline staff has been supremely unhelpful for this
Is there any way to get it changed to CanSino?
27/08/2021, 3:36 pm - +92 333 2156839: same thing happened to my friend.contact directly Nadra
27/08/2021, 3:36 pm - +92 336 2729373: What number? The NADRA helpline people clearly said only to contact them for NIC related issues and nothing else
27/08/2021, 4:00 pm - +92 302 9256676: Moderna Available At JPMC.

27/08/2021, 4:03 pm - +92 333 6571330: You should visit the center and ask them to change the record, Bring her vaccination card with you.
Nadra help line will not facilitate you in this regard.
Thank you

27/08/2021, 4:06 pm - +92 345 2003237: Try checking on website first, if not , then as dr akhtar said , go to the vaccination centre 
Hope it helps
27/08/2021, 4:08 pm - +92 336 2729373: Thank you! I've already checked on the website. I also keep getting the 1166 reminders for second dose.
The vaccination center said they can't do anything because it's in the NADRA record and they don't have access to it.
27/08/2021, 4:10 pm - +92 345 2003237: Ok 
The was a similar problem with my relative’s card but it worked out fine with the website
27/08/2021, 4:18 pm - +92 336 2729373: Oh that's nice
I hope this can get fixed soon too since she needs to travel in a few weeks inshaAllah 

I had an issue with my own record as well but that somehow got fixed by itself several months later, despite my repeated trying

28/08/2021, 3:01 pm - +92 322 2142046: Just got my similar issue resolved . 
You have to visit the vaccination center, NIMS / NADRA won'tt help. 
They will have to update the record. Also if she needs to travel soon, you needs to visit the center asap, as in my case record update took 27days . And they had to change my vaccination dates as according to the centers they cant feed records in back dates.
28/08/2021, 3:09 pm - +92 336 2729373: Okay, thank you so much for the help!
InshaAllah will visit vaccination center again
28/08/2021, 4:07 pm - +92 331 2267231: Their website is not always updated. The certificate I downloaded showed incomplete vaccination although I both doses done back in May. Had to reach out to Nadra. It was updated with them so they gave my actual certificate there and then.

29/08/2021, 7:56 pm - Madia MHM: Yes they can't change the vaccine name
29/08/2021, 7:57 pm - Madia MHM: The same issues came in our hospital also  and still we are unable to change..once NIMS entry done nobody can change it..
29/08/2021, 7:57 pm - Madia MHM: But it came to know me from 1st of the september it will be possible for changing the vaccine name only for visa purpose with the payment of Fee...
29/08/2021, 7:59 pm - Madia MHM: My aunt has also the same case...Her vaccination was done with sinovac vaccine but in her NIMS entry Astrazeneca is mentioned.

That's as high as one person every hour. 

Pakistan is among the few countries of the world where attempting suicide is a criminal offence! 

The legal status of suicide in a country has a massive impact on the reporting of such cases.

We're initiating a Petition to Decriminalize Suicide. Because we believe in #MujrimnahiMareez

05/09/2021, 3:56 pm - +92 313 2402216: Aldosterone

05/09/2021, 3:56 pm - +92 313 2402216: So they are bald
05/09/2021, 4:12 pm - +92 345 3086513: Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid, not related to baldness.
05/09/2021, 4:13 pm - +92 345 3086513: It’s androgen that causes baldness
05/09/2021, 4:13 pm - +92 345 3086513: LH is needed for Androgen production.
05/09/2021, 4:14 pm - +92 331 0310288: Can anyone confirm
05/09/2021, 4:14 pm - +92 345 3086513: But I’m not sure of the gene of baldness.
05/09/2021, 4:17 pm - +92 334 7328020: Agreed. testosterone is correct in my opinion but other option is LH.LH produces testosterone from testes.

opera.comMar 30, 2020 2:47 PM

Without the Kaaba this world can stop, Sub-haanallaah:

 Americana writes: "If Muslims stop performing tawaf or prayers on this earth, surely our earth's rotation will stop, because the rotation of the super conductor centered on the Black Stone, will no longer scatter electromagnetic waves.

 According to the results of research from 15 universities show Hajar Aswad is a meteorite that has a very high metal content, which is 23,000 times that of existing steel. Some astronauts who took to see a very bright light emanating from the earth and after research turned out to be sourced from the Temple or the Kaaba. The super conductor is Hajar Aswad, who functions like a microphone that is broadcast and reaches thousands of miles of broadcast range.

 Prof. Lawrence E. Yoseph - Fl Whiple wrote: "We really owe a huge debt to Muslims, because tawaf and prayers are on time to keep the super conductor.

 "Sub-haanallaah, Alhamdulillaah, Laa Ilaaha illallaah, Allaahu Akbar. How thrilled we are to see the enormity of the movements of the Hajj and Umrah.

Australia deserved the win
11/11/2021, 10:42 pm - Dr Fehmina: HASAN ali gave away the match
11/11/2021, 10:42 pm - +92 321 2251918: Bhai abi ni kru!

Team Pakistan
11/11/2021, 10:43 pm - +92 321 8050020: Actually the catch dropped by Hassan determined the Australian victory.
He didn’t bowl well and contributed lots of runs to Ausies and then in the end put the last nail in coffin of Pak victory by dropping the crucial catch.
11/11/2021, 10:44 pm - Dr Fehmina: Exactly this
11/11/2021, 10:44 pm - Dr Fehmina: We have lost the almost winning series
11/11/2021, 10:44 pm - Dr Fehmina: Such a hard luck
11/11/2021, 10:44 pm - +92 321 8050020: But then it’s part of game. One had to win. And i am sure no body wants to drop a catch intentionally
11/11/2021, 10:45 pm - Dr Fehmina: He wasn’t in form. Wasn’t concentrated on the match. Too overconfident that has contributed in the loss
11/11/2021, 10:46 pm - +92 331 2869862: Almost replay of yesterday's semifinal
11/11/2021, 10:46 pm - Dr Fehmina: Had it been a good fielding and we had lost it, I would respect but this was shear disappointment
11/11/2021, 10:46 pm - Dr Fehmina: Team performed well but at the end gave away runs and didn’t put the pressure instead took the pressure
11/11/2021, 10:47 pm - +92 342 5264195: Its okay!! All is well!!
11/11/2021, 10:47 pm - Dr Farha: Hahaha yes we are always under pressure when playing with the Aussies...

11/11/2021, 10:54 pm - Dr Fehmina: Yar this wasn’t a one sided match ko generally hota hai. This time we fought for it lekin one person contributed to the loss
11/11/2021, 10:54 pm - Dr Fehmina: Others did try
11/11/2021, 10:54 pm - +92 336 2113143: I second dr fahmeena

آپ سب کی اطلاع کے لئے عرض ہے کہ ایشیا کا بڑا کینسر ہسپتال جس کا نام
Cancer care hospital
کینسر کئیرھاسپیٹل ہے ۔ لاھور کے نزدیک رائے ونڈ تبلیغی جماعت کے مرکز کے قریب وسیع رقبہ پر تعمیر کیا گیا ہے ۔ 
یہ شوکت خانم ہسپتال سے بھی زیادہ جدید مشینری سے آراستہ ہے ۔
اس ہسپتال نے کام شروع کر دیا ھے۔ ہسپتال میں دور دراز سے آئے لوگوں کے لئیے قیام گاہ بھی تعمیر کی گئی ہے۔ یہاں پر غریب لوگوں کا علاج قیام وطعام بالکل مفت ھے صرف صاحب حیثیت لوگوں سے علاج کے مناسب پیسے لئیے جاتے ہیں۔ 
یہاں پر افغانستان، خیبر پختون خواہ اور گلگت بلتستان وغیرہ سے مریض آ رھے ہیں جن کا علاج مفت کیا جا رہا ھے۔ 
شوکت خانم ہسپتال  میں لاعلاج مریضوں کو گھر بھیج دیا جاتا ھے جہاں وہ بہت تکلیف دہ حالت میں موت کا انتظار کرتے ہیں لیکن یہاں پر الحمد للہ 250 بیڈ کا علیحدہ بلاک قائم کیا گیا ہے جہاں پر لاعلاج مریضوں کو ڈیتھ (موت) تک رکھا جاتا ہے اور ان کی زندگی میں تکلیف کو ہر ممکن کم کیا جاتا ہے و خدمت کی جاتی ہے یہ بہت بڑی سہولت ھے۔

آپ سب سے گزارش ہے کہ لوگوں کو زیادہ سے زیادہ اس ہسپتال کے متعلق آگاہ کریں تاکہ کینسر زدہ مریض اس سہولت سے فائدہ اٹھا سکیں۔ 
یہاں پر پاکستان کے نامور اور انتہائی تجربہ کار ڈاکٹر صاحبان کی ٹیم کام کر رہی ہے۔ 
ہسپتال میں مریضوں اور ان کے لواحقین کے لئیے ایک عالیشان اور جدید سہولتوں سے آراستہ مسجد بھی تعمیر کی گئی ھے۔
 پاکستان نیک و مخیر حضرات کی وجہ سے قائم ھے اور یہ اللہ تعالی کا خاص کرم ہے ۔ 

ڈاکٹر شہریار ۔ ماہر کینسر (جوکہ ہسپتال کے انچارج بھی ہیں) نے بتایا کہ کوئی صاحب جن کو وہ بھی نہیں جانتے ہیں روزانہ 250 مریضوں اور ان کے لواحقین کے لئے کھانا بھجوا رہے ہیں ۔ *سبحان اللہ ۔*

17/11/2021, 10:48 am - +92 302 9256676: In last 10 years, TEN major reason for financial crisis of many families :-

1. Everyone in family owns smartphone.
2. Vacations under social pressure.
3. Buying a car as a status symbol.
4. Avoiding home made food and unnecessarily eating out on weekends.
5. Brand conscious for salons, parlours and clothes. Spoiled lifestyle increasing medical expenses.
6. Trying to make Birthday and anniversary special by spending more money rather than time together.
7. Grand weddings and family functions.
8. Commercialization of Hospitals, Schools and tuitions.. education...etc.
9. Spending what you haven't yet earned...by loans and credit cards...
10. Spending tons of money on interiors of house & office and thereby increasing the Maintenance cost....

We are copying others' lifestyle without understanding our own needs and income. If this does not get curtailed,  it will lead to lots more stress and anxiety with passing years (as habits don't change).

26/11/2021, 8:21 am - +92 334 7328020: *"ہم نے کچھ غلط نہیں کیا ، لیکن پھر بھی ہم ہار گئے۔"*

نوکیا کمپنی جب بکنے لگی اور مائیکرو سافٹ اسے لینے کا اعلان کرنے لگا تو اس پریس کانفرنس کے دوران ، نوکیا کے سی ای او نے اپنی تقریر کا اختتام یہ کہہ کر کیا:
"ہم نے کچھ غلط نہیں کیا ، لیکن پھر بھی ہم ہار گئے۔"
 اس کے ساتھ ہی ، پوری مینجمنٹ ٹیم ، بشمول وہ خود سب رو پڑے۔

نوکیا ایک قابل احترام کمپنی تھی۔  اس نے اپنے کاروبار میں کچھ غلط نہیں کیا لیکن دنیا بہت تیزی سے بدلی اور وہ سیکھنے سے محروم رہے اور وہ تبدیلی سے محروم ہو گئے ، اور اس طرح انہوں نے ایک قیمتی موقع ضائع کر دیا جو کہ ایک بڑی کمپنی بننے کا تھا۔ انہوں نے نہ صرف بڑی رقم کمانے کا ایک موقع گنوایا ، بلکہ انہوں نے زندہ رہنے کا موقع بھی گنوا دیا!

*اس کہانی کا پیغام:*

 *اگر آپ تبدیل نہیں ہوتے ہیں تو آپ مقابل لوگوں سے ہار جائیں گے اور ماضی کی داستان بن جائیں گے۔*
*اگر آپ نئی چیزیں نہیں سیکھنا چاہتے اور آپ کے خیالات اور ذہنیت وقت کے ساتھ نہیں بدل رہی تو آپ وقت کے ساتھ ختم ہو جائیں گے!*
*انسان تب تک کامیاب رہتا ہے جب تک وہ سیکھتا ہے ، اور اگر اسے لگتا ہے کہ اس نے کافی کچھ سیکھ لیا ہے اور یہ اسکے لیے کافی ہے تو اس نے اپنے آپ کو ناکامی کی طرف دھکیل دیا ہے جو ایک دن اسے یہ سوچ سٹیوو بالمر جیسے کامیاب کمپنی کے مالک کی طرح رونے پہ مجبور کر دے گی۔*

This is not just one incidence 
It is not only about extremists

06/12/2021, 4:09 pm - +92 345 2003237: Law and order , I agree , needs to be enforced woth more rigor

06/12/2021, 7:11 pm - Dr Farha: Why thousands of people maybe much more in number were not able to stop this act of barbarism 
On record it was only one person who showed the courage to stand in front of the mob mu h more in numbers
06/12/2021, 7:12 pm - Dr Farha: *Thousands of hardworking, nice and helping...
06/12/2021, 7:12 pm - +92 333 7304573: Thats the point i want to raise we as society are lost 
Only few people are honest and stand by truth

06/12/2021, 7:14 pm - +92 333 7304573: Its actually not the mob it is actually lack of moral in the society ... And yes this country is becoming heaven for this type of mindset

06/12/2021, 7:16 pm - +92 345 2003237: Ammar, 29, describes the scene as recounted by their younger brother Basil Baig, who was also in attendance at Friday’s concert. “People started hitting them, people started hitting his fiancée, started [doing] a lot of things to her. She’s bruised up, and he was trying to save her,” he says, adding, “And no one there was there to help him.”
06/12/2021, 7:17 pm - Dr Farha: These concert hooliganism happens everywhere....
It's no comparison to what happened in sialkot
06/12/2021, 7:20 pm - +92 333 7304573: Niether a dead body was humiliated like that .... In that instance ... In concert they were not targeted  its different
06/12/2021, 7:22 pm - +92 333 7304573: If people would have died in jalsa due to mismanagement in pakistan we would have not been in deep sense of trouble like we are now 
That instance is management failure 
And this instance is mind set and society issue.

Ordering a Pizza in 2022

CALLER:
    Is this Pizza Hut?
 
GOOGLE:    
No sir, it's Google Pizza.
 
CALLER:  
I must have dialed a wrong number, sorry.
 
GOOGLE:  
No sir, Google bought Pizza Hut last month.
 
CALLER:  
OK. I would like to order a pizza.
 
GOOGLE:  
Do you want your usual, sir?
 
CALLER:
My usual? You know me?
 
GOOGLE:
According to our caller ID data sheet, the last 12 times you called you ordered an extra-large pizza with three cheeses, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and meatballs on a thick crust.
 
CALLER:  
Super! That’s what I’ll have.
 
GOOGLE:
May I suggest that this time you order a pizza with ricotta, arugula, sun-dried tomatoes and olives on a whole wheat gluten-free thin crust?
 
CALLER:  
What? I don’t want a vegetarian pizza!
 
GOOGLE:  
Your cholesterol is not good, sir.
 
CALLER:  
How the hell do you know that?
 
GOOGLE:
Well, we cross-referenced your home phone number with your medical records. We have the result of your blood tests for the last 7 years.
 
CALLER:
Okay, but I do not want your rotten vegetarian pizza!  I already take medication for my cholesterol.
 
GOOGLE:
Excuse me sir, but you have not taken your medication regularly.  According to our database, you purchased only a box of 30 cholesterol tablets once at Lloyds Pharmacy, 4 months ago.
 
CALLER:  
I bought more from another Pharmacy.
 
GOOGLE:  
That doesn’t show on your credit card statement.
 
CALLER: 
I paid in cash.
 
GOOGLE:  
But you did not withdraw enough cash according to your bank statement.
 
CALLER:  
I have other sources of cash.
 
GOOGLE:
That doesn’t show on your latest tax returns, unless you bought them using an undeclared income source, which is against the law!
 
CALLER:    
WHAT THE HELL!
 
GOOGLE:  
I'm sorry sir, we use such information only with the sole intention of helping you.
 
CALLER:  
Enough already!  I'm sick to death of Google, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and all the others.  I'm going to an island without the internet, TV, where there is no phone service and no one to watch me or spy on me.
 
GOOGLE:      
I understand sir, but you need to renew your passport first. It expired 6 weeks ago...

17/12/2021, 5:38 pm - +92 345 3546684: A major example of this is paracetamol. A standard in most homes, we use paracetamol fairly regularly for pain such as headaches or muscle pain. Sadly, paracetamol is hugely toxic in cats and as little as a single tablet can kill. This also includes child liquid formulations.
17/12/2021, 5:41 pm - +92 345 3546684: paracetamol is extremely toxic. Cats cannot break down paracetamol and toxins are produced that seriously damage their liver and red blood cells.04-Sept-2020

25/01/2022, 9:55 am - +92 342 5264195: The only way they can be forced id if they are travelling. Then they would need it.

25/01/2022, 3:43 pm - +92 334 7328020: Ischemic stroke
Must consult with neurologist and then cardiologist if refferred
25/01/2022, 3:44 pm - +92 322 2286094: Can the calcium plaque be dissolved? Can it be removed with cholesterol reducing medicines or is surgery needed?

25/01/2022, 4:00 pm - +92 344 2663311: Depending upon the approach of his doctor there are multiple ways of treating such patient.
There is a drug name VASTERAL MR. This drug enhances the energy production leading to improvement of symptoms. I think this drug would help him but do discuss with his doctor before initiating.
Also all sort of vasodilators would help in such situations including Magnesium Sulphate 10mg IV.

25/01/2022, 6:37 pm - +92 313 2402216: No treatment should be initiated on advise of people who are not seeing the patient on reports
25/01/2022, 6:38 pm - +92 313 2402216: Kindly refrain from advices and medication
25/01/2022, 6:39 pm - +92 313 2402216: If she needs help in reading the report one may help but treatment without seeing the actual condition of the patient is not appropriate

26/01/2022, 11:07 am - +92 333 7304573: Don't agree with logic you are giving it feels like we are living in a different country ... I do live with this system every day ..  people are forced to be corrupt due to system ...
My point is no healthy system persist in our country weather health law or private sector
26/01/2022, 11:08 am - +92 333 7304573: Don't agree at all
26/01/2022, 11:08 am - +92 313 2402216: Na agree karo
26/01/2022, 11:09 am - +92 336 2729373: The question isn't whether he was COVID negative or positive. The problem here is that he received a call 2 days later offering to "fix" it for him, which points towards a proper established scam system, which is giving wrong reports for money.
26/01/2022, 11:09 am - +92 313 2402216: Agreed
26/01/2022, 11:09 am - +92 333 7304573: We are not talking about other countries .... We are looking at our country that we are continuously going backwards
26/01/2022, 11:09 am - +92 333 7304573: Exactly point this we know errors happen but these type of people in the system are never punished here

It's the same as blaming others for our problems. We should fix ourselves instead of looking for the easy way out by putting the blame on conspiracy theories, poori duniya humaari hi dushman hai jaisey. Hum apney dushman khud hain.

26/01/2022, 11:21 am - +92 336 2729373: It's our Pakistani nation's deep rooted narcissism that we feel everyone is wrong but ourselves and that is exactly why we haven't been able to fix ourselves in 70 years. We love to blame everyone. We blame the British, we blame India, we blame Afghanistan, we blame the Gulf countries, we blame America, everyone else for problems we have created ourselves.
Jub kisi ne aaina dikhaya toh us ko bhi ghalat kehna hai.
26/01/2022, 11:21 am - Dr Farha: @923132402216 come back to reality it seems that you live in utopia

26/01/2022, 11:24 am - Dr Farha: Just Compare yourself with Bangladesh they are far better off than us
26/01/2022, 11:24 am - Dr Farha: Because they take action where they are wrong
26/01/2022, 11:24 am - Dr Farha: And we are still defending our wrong doing
26/01/2022, 11:28 am - +92 336 2729373: Our only hope forward is a strong legal system with accountability, to weed out the bad eggs, make the corrupt pay
And that can only be achieved through a strong govt. We blame the govt for everything too. 
But the govt of a country only reflects its own people
26/01/2022, 11:29 am - Dr Farha: Only yesterday someone told me that in government colleges they make dentist interns sign contract paying them 40k on paper but salary which comes in account is 20k
26/01/2022, 11:30 am - +92 333 7304573: Agree but this seems not to be happening here any time  soon. Education and strong legal system is only way forward... We are lacking both
26/01/2022, 11:55 am - +92 313 2402216: We make people corrupt
26/01/2022, 11:55 am - +92 313 2402216: And then we cry
26/01/2022, 11:55 am - +92 313 2402216: Who started to give money to vaccinators to provide them with false certificate
26/01/2022, 11:56 am - +92 313 2402216: Who wants negative results
26/01/2022, 11:56 am - +92 313 2402216: To travel n bribe the labs
26/01/2022, 11:56 am - +92 313 2402216: We are

26/01/2022, 11:56 am - +92 313 2402216: We make our own system corrupt and then then cry for it

26/01/2022, 11:57 am - +92 313 2402216: But there will be people who are influenced with money
26/01/2022, 11:58 am - +92 313 2402216: Its basically ur values our own moral n ethical values

06/04/2022, 7:54 am - Dr Anila: *ALL ARE GOOD, BUT IN DIFFERENT WAYS*

Some have the ability to wake up in the middle of the night for *Tahajjud Salaat* daily, but others cannot wake up despite much effort.

However, they fast on *Mondays and Thursdays* throughout the year. 

Others cannot do both of the above, but wherever they walk, they give *generously to beggars.*

Some don't have the strength to carry out extra ibaadah, but keep a *clean heart and a smiling face* towards people all the time.

Others do nothing but just make *kids laugh whenever they meet them*

The point?

Don't ever think that those who don't do what you do are inferior in any way or have nothing to offer.

*Never think that your acts of Ibaadah are better than others*.

Never let your piety develop subtle pride in you.

There are many in the world who are close to Allah despite them seeming ordinary. 

Your affiliation to a Jamaah, any scholarly institute, should be a means of annihilating your ego and pride, not looking down on others.

There are many whose hearts are pure despite not being affiliated to any of the above.

*These are not automatic passports to Jannah.* 

*A person earned the favor of Jannah just by quenching the thirst of a dog,  another earned it by just forgiving everyone daily before going to bed.*

*They had nothing much to show, but what they did, mattered to Allah.* 

Someone may walk through the gates of Jannah with very little, regardless of how unimportant people considered him to be on earth, *while others with far greater deeds perish because of their arrogance and pride.*

*Don't be surprised if that person leads you in walking through the gates of Jannah.*

*ALWAYS LOOK AT THE GOOD IN OTHERS*

When an elected government  wasn't allowed to complete its tenure, by manipulating members of the Parliament elected by the masses to give mandate to a particular leading party
To bring those back into power who had been responsible for the problems in the first place despite ruling for 30 years

11/04/2022, 11:47 am - Dr Farha: There was a perverse practice in Pakistani law until 2006 that if a woman goes to a court accusing a guy of raping her but could not prove the rape, court would prosecute her for having consensual sex. 

Asma Jahangir and others spoke and protested about it at length. General Musharraf's administration introduced a bill in assembly, called Women's Protection Bill,  that would stop courts from prosecuting these women (and some men) for confessing and having consensual sex with their accused rapists in case the women couldn't prove their rape allegations. 

*** Guess who voted against this bill in 2006 along with JI and JUI? Yes, Imran Khan. ***

Thankfully the law passed because PPP, PMLN and MQM voted for it. 

Don't tell me that Imran Khan is a better leader than them. Only a monster could vote against that bill and he did. And no he didn't change, he became worse during his tenure so did the living conditions of common Pakistanis.

13/04/2022, 10:14 pm - +92 336 2729373: Our batch had an experience with PMDC first and then with PMC as well
PMDC ki wohi puraani kahaaniyan theen, no email replies, no response to calls, lawaaris ki tarah bus idhar se udhar bhataktey raho, if you're lucky toh document bhooley bhulaaye 6 mahiney baad aajayega jub aap khud thak haar k bhool jaogey. Jub tak provisional license mila, tub tak expiry ka time aachuka tha.
Then came PMC. Finally an updated clearly defined website, with an easy to use interface, applied for full license online and got it back the same day! No jhanjhat of going to banks and getting pay orders and 50 documents ki copies karwa k bhejo, waste of time at every step 
Aap log khud hi kehtey hain is group pe jis ki jo achi cheez hai us pe bilawajah ki behas nahin karni chahye.

اقبال احمد  انڈیا کے ایک چھوٹے سے گاؤں میں پیدا ہوئے‘ والد زمین کے جھگڑے میں ان کی آنکھوں کے سامنے قتل ہو گئے‘ 1947میں اپنے بھائی کے ساتھ بہار سے پیدل لاہور پہنچے‘ ایف سی کالج میں داخلہ لیا‘ اکنامکس میں ڈگری لی اور اسکالرشپ پر کیلی  فورنیا امریکا کے   کالج میں داخل ہو گئے اور سیاست اور مڈل ایسٹ ہسٹری پڑھنا شروع کر دی، ابن خلدون کی محبت میں گرفتار ہوئے اور خود کو مڈل ایسٹ اور شمالی افریقہ کی تاریخ کے لیے وقف کر دیا‘   نوم چومسکی‘ ایڈورڈ سعید اور ارون دتی رائے جیسے دانشور اقبال احمد سے متاثر ہوئے اور انھیں اپنا دوست بنا لیا‘ یہ ان کی محفل میں اٹھنے بیٹھنے لگے‘ زندگی کی سختیوں اور عالمی دانشوروں کی صحبت نے انھیں جنگ کا دشمن اور عالمی نظام معیشت کا مخالف بنا دیا اور یہ کھل کر کمیونزم کا پرچار کرنے لگے‘یہ پوری دنیا میں لیکچر دیتے تھے اور لوگ ٹکٹ خرید کر ان کا لیکچر سنتے تھے‘ بڑے بڑے دانشور ان سے متاثر تھے‘
 میاں نواز شریف 1997 میں اقبال احمد کو پاکستان لے آئے اور انھیں ٹیکسٹائل انسٹی ٹیوٹ آف پاکستان کا سربراہ بنا دیا‘ نواز شریف نے انھیں اسلام آباد میں پرائیویٹ اور خود مختار یونیورسٹی بنانے کے لیے زمین بھی الاٹ کر دی‘ یہ ابن خلدون کے نام پر پاکستان میں خلدونیہ یونیورسٹی بنانا چاہتے تھے۔
حکومت نے انھیں چارٹر دے دیا‘ اقبال احمد نے کام شروع کر دیا لیکن یہ بدقسمتی سے بڑی آنت کے کینسر میں مبتلا ہوئے‘ ان کا آپریشن ہوا اور یہ آپریشن کے دوران 11 مئی 1999 کو ہارٹ اٹیک سے انتقال کر گئے‘ یہ کتنے بڑے اسکالر اور نامور انسان تھے آپ اس کا اندازہ صرف ایک بات سے لگا لیجیے‘ ان کے انتقال پر ہیمپشائر کالج نے تعزیتی تقریب منعقد کی‘ اس تقریب میں اقوام متحدہ کے سیکریٹری جنرل کوفی عنان‘ ایڈورڈ سعید‘ نوم چومسکی اور ارون دتی رائے جیسے لوگ شریک ہوئے اور کھل کر ان کی خدمات کا اعتراف کیا۔
 اقبال احمد کا یہ سارا بیک گراؤنڈ صرف ایک واقعہ سنانے کے لیے لکھا‘ اقبال صاحب 40سال بعد پاکستان واپس آئے اور یہ اسلام آباد میں رہائش پذیر ہو گئے تو ایک دن ان کے ایک دوست نے ان سے پوچھا ’’آپ پاکستان میں رہتے ہوئے امریکا‘ یورپ اور مڈل ایسٹ کی کون سی چیز مس کرتے ہیں‘‘ یہ مسکرا کر بولے ’’اچھی گفتگو‘‘ پوچھنے والے نے حیرت سے عرض کیا ’’کیا مطلب‘‘ یہ بولے ’’دنیا جہاں میں پڑھے لکھے لوگوں کے پاس گفتگو کے بے شمار موضوعات ہوتے ہیں لیکن پاکستان میں ان پڑھ ہوں یا پڑھے لکھے، ریڑھی والے ہوں یا آفس میں بیٹھے باس ،  ان کے پاس سیاست اور سکینڈلز کے علاوہ کوئی موضوع نہیں ہوتا‘ آپ جس بھی محفل میں بیٹھ جائیں اور کوئی بھی موضوع چھیڑ دیں وہ محفل چند منٹوں میں سیاست اور سیاست دانوں کے سکینڈلز میں تبدیل ہو جائے گی اور لوگ اس پر گھنٹوں گفتگو کرتے رہیں گے‘ اور اس گفتگو کا حاصل بھی کچھ نہیں، دنیا بھر میں لوگ آئیڈیاز پر بات کرتے ہیں لیکن پاکستان میں ہر جگہ‘ ہر محفل میں شخصیات آئیڈیاز کی جگہ لے لیتی ہیں چناں چہ میں پاکستان میں اچھی گفتگو کومس کرتا ہوں‘‘۔
اقبال احمد نے آج سے 25سال قبل ہمارے ملک کی نفسیاتی حالت پر کیا خوب صورت تبصرہ کیا تھا اور یہ صورت حال سوشل میڈیا اور واٹس ایپ سے پہلے کے پاکستان کی تھی‘ اللہ نے اقبال صاحب پر بڑا کرم کیا‘ یہ سوشل میڈیا کی ایجاد سے پہلے دنیا سے رخصت ہو گئے ورنہ یہ آج پاگل ہو کر سڑکوں پر پھر رہے ہوتے ‘ ہمارے ملک میں واقعی ’’اچھی گفتگو‘‘ کا خوف ناک قحط ہے‘ آپ ملک کے کسی حصے میں چلے جائیں‘ کسی فورم‘ کسی گروپ کا حصہ بن جائیں۔آپ کو سیاسی افواہوں‘ سیاسی لطیفوں اور سیاسی گپ شپ کے علاوہ کچھ نہیں ملے گا اور آپ اگر کسی طرح سیاست سے جان چھڑا بھی لیں تو آپ مذہبی گفتگو کے تالاب میں گر جائیں گے اور وہ ساری بات چیت بھی سیاسی گفتگو کی طرح غیر مصدقہ واقعات پر مشتمل ہو گی‘ہمارا پورا ملک بولنے کے خبط میں مبتلا ہے‘ہم میں سے ہر شخص روزانہ تین چار کروڑ لفظ بول کر سوتا ہے۔
بعض لوگوں کی اس میں بھی تسلی نہیں ہوتی چناں چہ یہ نیند میں بھی بڑبڑاتے رہتے ہیں لیکن آپ جب اس گفتگو کا عرق نکالتے ہیں تو اس میں سے شخصیت پرستی اور سیاست کے علاوہ کچھ نہیں نکلتا‘ ہم میں سے ہر شخص اندھا دھند بولنا چاہتا ہے اور یہ اس میں کوئی کسر نہیں چھوڑتا ‘ اس کی گفتگو میں سیاست اور مذہب کے علاوہ کچھ نہیں ہوتا اور یہ بھی سنی سنائی اور غیرمصدقہ باتیں ہوتی ہیں‘ 
انسان بولنے والا جانور ہے‘ یہ اظہار کرتا ہے اور اظہار کے لیے آئیڈیاز چاہیے ہوتے ہیں اور آئیڈیاز کے لیے معلومات اور علم درکار ہوتا ہے اور علم اور معلومات کے لیے پڑھنا اور گھومنا اور گھومنے اور پڑھنے والے لوگوں کی صحبت میں بیٹھنا پڑتا ہے اور ہم یہ کرتے نہیں ہیں لہٰذا پھر ہم کیا سنیں گے اور کیا سنائیں گے‘ ہم کیا گفتگو کریں گے؟  نیا خیال نیا آئیڈیا کہاں سے آئے گا؟ ہم کیا گفتگو کریں گے!  اس لیے اس معاشرے میں علم ، معلومات ، اچھی گفتگو، نئے آئیڈیاز کی کمی ہے چناں چہ اس کمی نے ہمارے معاشرے میں ایک  اچھی گفتگو کا بحران پیدا کر دیا ہے۔ 
اچھی گفتگو کے لیے ضروری ہے کہ خوشامد اور تحسین میں فرق رکھا جائے خوشامد جھوٹی بات اور تحسین پر خلوص بات ہوتی ہے لوگوں کے ساتھ بات کریں تو ان کی ضرورتوں پر بات کریں اور اس کی تکمیل کا راستہ بنایا جائے ، ہمیشہ دوسروں کے نقطہ نظر کو سمجھنے کی کوشش کریں،  لوگوں میں سچی دلچسپی لیں ، یہ آفاقی  سچائی ہے کہ ہروہ آدمی جس سے آپ ملتے ہیں اپنے آپ کو کسی نہ کسی طرح آپ سے بہتر خیال کررہا ہوتا ہے اور اس کے دل میں گھر کرنے کا یہ بہترین طریقہ ہے کہ اسے باور کرائیں کہ آپ اس کو ایک اہم شخصیت مانتے ہیں ، حجت بازی سے ہمیشہ پرہیز کریں  کبھی کوئی بحث وتکرار سے نہیں جیت سکا ،دوسروں  کے نقطہ نظر سے چیزوں کو دیکھنا اور اس کے منہ سے "ہاں" کہلوانا بہت نفع بخش اور دل چسپ بات ہے ، ہمیشہ دوسرے شخص کو زیادہ سے زیادہ بات کرنے کا موقع دیں اپنے کارناموں کا تذکرہ کم سے کم کریں اور اعتدال پسندی سے کام لیں،اس دنیا میں ہم سب کو جو آواز اچھی لگتی ہے وہ ہمارے نام کی ہے ،کسی آدمی کا نام اس کےلیے سب سے میٹھی اور اہم آواز ہے، یہی وجہ ہے کہ جب بھی ہم نیا پین لیتے ہیں تو سب سے پہلے اس سے اپنا نام لکھتے ہیں،  لہذالوگوں کو اچھے ناموں سے پکارا کریں اس سے معاشرے میں بہتری بھی آئے گی اورآپ بھی مطمئن زندگی گزاریں گے۔

"محلے میں بچوں کو عربی و ناظرہ قرآن پڑھانے والی باجی کے گھر آٹا اور سبزی نہیں ہے، مگر وہ باپردہ خاتون باہر آکر مفت راشن والی لائن میں لگنے سے گھبرا رہی ہیں."

فری راشن تقسیم کرنے والے نوجوانوں کو جیسے ہی یہ بات پتا چلی، انہوں نے متاثرین میں فری سبزی و آٹا کی تقسیم فوراً روک دیا. پڑھے لکھے نوجوان تھے. آپس میں رائے مشورہ کرنے لگے. بات چیت میں طے ہوا کہ نہ جانے کتنے سفید پوش اپنی آنکھوں میں ضرورت کے پیالے  لیے فری راشن کی لائنوں کو تکتے ہیں، مگر اپنی عزت نفس کا بھرم رکھنے کی خاطر قریب نہیں پھٹکتے.

مشورے کے بعد نوجوانوں نے فری راشن کی تقسیم کا بورڈ بدل دیا اور دوسرا بورڈ آویزاں کردیا. 

ہر طرح کی سبزی 15 روپے کلو، مسالہ فری، آٹا، چاول، دال 15 روپے کلو. خصوصی آفر. 

اعلان سنتے ہی مفت خور بھکاریوں نے اپنی راہ لی، سفید پوش اور لاچار طبقہ ہاتھوں میں دس بیس روپے کے ساتھ خریداری کے لئے آگیا. قطار میں کھڑا ہونے سے اسے گھبراہٹ نہ ہوئی، نہ ہلڑ بازی ہوئی. 

لائن میں ایک طرف بچوں کو قرآن پڑھانے والی باپردہ باجی بھی مٹھی میں معمولی سی رقم لیے اعتماد کے ساتھ نمناک آنکھوں کے ساتھ کھڑی تھیں.
ان کی باری آئی پیسے دیئے، سامان لیا اور اطمینان سے گھر آگئیں. سامان کھولا، دیکھا ان کے ذریعہ ادا کی گئی پوری قیمت سنتِ یوسف(علیہ السلام) کی طرح ان کے سامان میں موجود ہے، لیکن انہیں خبر تک نہ ہو سکی تھی کہ کس نے وہ پیسے کب ان کے سامان میں رکھا تھا.
نوجوان ہر خریدار کے ساتھ یہی کررہے تھے. یقیناً علم کو جہالت پر مرتبہ حاصل ہے. 

مدد کیجیے، پر عزتِ نفس مجروح نہ کیجیے۔۔۔۔ضرورت مندوں کی ویڈیو اور تصاویر مت بنائیے!!

 ضرورت مند سفید پوشوں کا خیال رکھئے، عزت دار مساکین کو عزت دیجیے.
یقین رکھئے اللہ تعالیٰ آپ پر زیادہ بااختیار ہے.

صرف آپ ہی پڑھ کر آگے نہ بڑھ جائیں بلکہ اوروں کو بھی شریک کریں, یہ صدقہ جاریہ ہوگا, اس میں آپ کا بمشکل ایک لمحہ صرف ہو گا لیکن ہو سکتا ہے اس ایک لمحہ کی اٹھائی ہوئی تکلیف سے آپ کی شیئر کردہ تحریر ہزاروں لوگوں کے لیے سبق آموز ثابت ہو۔

 جزاک اللہ خیرا کثیرا.

26/04/2022, 9:13 pm - +92 321 8050020: WHAT IS *ROAD HYPNOSIS* ?
       Road hypnosis is a physical condition that most drivers are unaware of.
    ROAD HYPNOSIS usually starts *2.5 hours to 3 hours* after getting on the road, the eyes of the hypnosis driver is open, but the brain does not record and analyze what the eye sees.

          ROAD HYPNOSIS is the number one cause of *rear-end crashes* to parked vehicle or TRUCK in front of you.

       The driver with ROAD HYPNOSIS *remembers nothing* of the last 15 minutes until the moment of collision. He cannot analyze how many km speed he is going, or the speed of the car in front of him, usually the collision is above 140 km.

       In order to protect yourself from ROAD HYPNOSIS, it is necessary to stop, take a walk, drink tea or coffee after every 2.5 hours.

- It is important to note and remember certain places and vehicles while driving.

- If you don't remember anything from the last 15 minutes, it means you are driving yourself and the passengers to death.

       ROAD HYPNOSIS happens *more often at night* and if the passengers are also sleeping, the situation is very severe.
      The driver should stop, rest, *walk 5-6 minutes* every 2.5 hours and keep his mind open.

    Accident is inevitable if the eyes are open but the *mind is closed* ..

29/04/2022, 6:48 pm - +92 321 8050020: Dear All,

Today (Friday, 29 April 2022), the Pakistan National Polio Laboratory at the NIH, Islamabad, has confirmed the detection of Type-1 Wild Poliovirus from the stool specimen from a 24-month old girl from district North Waziristan, KP. The girl had onset of paralysis on 14 April 2022.

This is the second Wild Poliovirus case in 2022 in Pakistan after the first one reported from the same district on 22 April 2022.

Pakistan had reported only one WPV1 case in 2021 which had onset of paralysis on 27 January in Killa Abdullah, Balochistan.

Genetic analysis of the new Type-1 Wild Poliovirus case shows that the virus belongs to YB3C cluster and is linked to the Poliovirus case reported last week. This indicates well-established Pild Poliovirus circulation within district North Waziristan.

Attached is the technical summary of the case.


Best Regards,
 
National Emergency Operation Centre for Polio Eradication

Greetings:
 
Thank you for reaching out. I hope you are well.
 
I have reviewed a number of articles published by Pakistani outlets in recent days. All contain some inaccuracies. Taken together, the articles make significant misstatements, including inaccuracies relating to the announcement and effective dates for ECFMG’s accreditation requirement, its impact on Pakistani physicians currently practicing in the United States (there is no impact), the number of accreditation agencies currently recognized by the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME), and the timeframe for the WFME Recognition process.
 
All of the information currently available from ECFMG on the accreditation requirement is at www.ecfmg.org/accreditation. If there are specific questions coming out of the webinar, please feel free to send them, and I will try to obtain a response.
 
As you may know, the Pakistan Medical Commission has announced that it has initiated the application process for WFME Recognition.
 
Please note that we expect to update information on the accreditation requirement in the months ahead. We recommend that you subscribe to our newsletter, The ECFMG Reporter, for the latest information.

24/08/2022, 9:56 pm - +92 345 3440087: Dear friends & family,

Sindh and Balochistan have received unprecedented rains in the ongoing monsoon season. The floods have caused colossal damage to life, property, crops and infrastructure across provinces. Innumerous families have been displaced with no shelter. 

In these incredibly tough times in the aftermath of floods, I along with my team, are collecting donations for those affected in the rain-hit areas.These donations will be utilised to purchase the basic necessities such as dry ration packs,clothes, medical aid etc. 

To ensure that your donations reach the deserving, we are collaborating with Pakistan Air Force to reach to the affected people directly and promptly.

Please donate generously to help save lives of our vulnerable Pakistani brothers and sisters and also encourage others to do the same. 

Kind regards,

Dr. Syed M Hamza

27/08/2022, 11:41 am - Maryum MHM: #FloodsInPakistan

Donate to organizations, individuals, govt, army ANYONE you think is helping the victims. If you don’t want to give money then give: 

1. Dry Milk
2. Water Bottles
3. Biscuits
4. Tarpals (plastic sheets)
5. Medicine for pneomina, diarrhoea, typhoid, upset stomach and malaria
6. Mosquito nets
7. Sanitary Pads
8. Any dry food
9. Soap

These are the worst ever floods Pakistan has ever seen. These people are facing what you cannot even imagine. They have NO dry land to sit on, no dry clothes, no food, no water, no livestock, no home absolutely nothing. Your Rs 100 can do wonders for them. Please donate, please keep sharing content related to floods so more people get aware. Please ask your friends and family abroad to send funds for floods. Sindh is terribly effected. Media isn't highlighting it much.  Things have take turn for worse in KPK. Balochistan aur South Punjab ka ap logon ko wesay hi pata hai. Thank you

Tips on how to save for Flood victims donations
1. If you are going out for a meal, skip the dessert, save that money, and donate
2. If you are going out to buy a dress, instead of spending Rs.5000 on it spend Rs.4500, save the Rs.500 and donate
3. For a week save Rs.20 each, by the end of the week it will be Rs.140 which equals two people having a meal
4. If you are going out to buy groceries skip the extra sauces and imported items and use that amount to donate
5. If you are going out on a vacation, skip the souvenir and utilize that money to donate.

Due to the catastrophic floods Roghay Sons has decided to help a large group (400 people to be exact)  stationed in a public school in larkana due to the floods. These people have lost everything and the government has moved them into a government school to keep them safe from the torrential rains and floods. As we pledge to help them with staple foods and ready made meals we are requesting everyone to help us If possible by contributing as much as possible to feed these 400 people. 

If you can’t help please share this message further. May Allah return all the support you provide to these homeless people 10 times over. 

If you wish to support feeding these people please let us know. If you wish to speak to someone from Roghay sons please contact 03002342005.

03/09/2022, 5:55 pm - +92 333 3621839: NICVD van had an accident on Monday night while travelling from Karachi to Sukkur via Larkana. It was vehicle malfunction, dim headlights, no windscreen wipers, no horn in the vehicle. The driver brutally killed 5 buffaloes on the rd and 1 dog enroute.
There were 10 people in the van. 2 anesthesia residents, 4 perfusionists and 4 surgery residents.
Despite high alert in interior Sindh, we were sent to that area and were given such a vehicle. The vehicle was rented, the dirver ran after the incident leaving the vehicle behind.
We called NICVD management for rescue. Got the rescue in 2hours.
Spent torturous 2 hours on a single dark rd, where it was a khaayi at the back and speedy cars in front. As there were no street lights, we had our phone torches on so we don't get hit by any car in the dark.
03/09/2022, 5:55 pm - +92 333 3621839: It has affected me mentally to go through such an accident, the vehicle has passed the rd boundary and is tilted on the slope, we had to step out of the vehicle on the slope where imbalance could led us in the khaayi and stay there for 2 ours with the killed buffaloes on the dark road.
03/09/2022, 5:55 pm - +92 333 3621839: I was having trouble sleeping when I came back on Tuesday. I'm doing better now. But since then I'm wondering what am I doing in such an organisation and why is the management so ruined.
They are running the satellites at the stake of employee lives. They always give us night travels, despite our resistance about how risky it is.
This accident did happen in night but we were travelling since 10am and the accident took place around 9pm
03/09/2022, 5:55 pm - +92 333 3621839: We usually take travel back to Khi around 9pm from Sukkur and reach Karachi by 4am or so.
We have complained multiple times.
NICVD has their own vans, which they didn't provide us, their transportation department must be held responsible for not checking the vehicle. We could have lost our lives yet we just got physical and mental trauma.
03/09/2022, 5:56 pm - +92 333 3621839: I'm sharing this with you, as healthcare managers and having our society, how can we influence NICVDs management?
03/09/2022, 5:56 pm - +92 333 3621839: This is just messed up.
03/09/2022, 5:57 pm - Dr Farha: @923132402216 healthcare commission should look into this...this is pathetic
03/09/2022, 6:04 pm - +92 331 2352217: Omg Fatima this is so scary and unfortunate. Alhamdulillah that you and the others traveling are safe and were not seriously injured. I'm so sorry this happened to you
03/09/2022, 6:07 pm - Dr Anila: As.salam.o.alaikum 
Oooh....sad to hear ...but Alhamdullilah u all are safe.

03/09/2022, 6:16 pm - +92 333 3621839: Yes, Alhamdulillah, we all are fine now.
We got minor injuries, one of us got into vasovagol syncope, others got bruises, soft tissue injury.
03/09/2022, 6:17 pm - +92 313 2402216: Complaint karain

03/09/2022, 6:18 pm - +92 346 3713045: Ya ALLAH this is so scary.. how pathetic NICVD management is.. ALHAMDULILLAH you all are safe, but this matter should be reported immediately to the higher authorities.. kch bh hoskta tha.. ALLAH apny hifz o amaan main rkhy sbko

03/09/2022, 6:20 pm - +92 333 3621839: We stayed in Larkana for the night and were called back to Karachi next morning as there were news that the very same route will all be drowned because there were breaches in FP bund.
So this is clear negligence to send us anyway in that area regardless of all the high alert.
03/09/2022, 6:21 pm - +92 333 3621839: Just after you crossed that road

It’s a relief to know that you all were safe after such a horrible accident!!!
03/09/2022, 6:27 pm - +92 322 2831991: 😳...this is so scary and torturous..thank God you all are safe...but this Is height of negligence..
03/09/2022, 6:27 pm - +92 313 2402216: Why u guys are travelling
03/09/2022, 6:27 pm - +92 313 2402216: In this situation
03/09/2022, 6:31 pm - +92 333 3621839: We resisted a lot in front of our HODs and everyone. Our management had forced us.

After this incident they have temporarily stopped it for 2 weeks because of the weather. But the incident was not because of the bad weather.
03/09/2022, 6:32 pm - +92 333 3621839: I think we should stop transport to Sukkur till rain situation improve
03/09/2022, 6:32 pm - +92 333 3621839: from the ED👆🏻
03/09/2022, 6:32 pm - +92 333 3621839: They have started thinking now. When the damage is done.
03/09/2022, 6:33 pm - +92 345 2003237: This is pathetic
03/09/2022, 6:40 pm - +92 302 9256676: This message was deleted

03/09/2022, 7:00 pm - +92 333 3621839: Okay sure. I'll write the application regarding the incident, it must be investigated for their negligence.
The thing why they are always forcing us is that they did this agreement with all their new hirings that they will be rotating to NICVD satellites and we agreed.

Similarly happened this time, we asked them not to move in such weather situation. The HOD replied, you agreed.
We signed the contract, not the death warrant.
They must have some protocols for employee safety.
03/09/2022, 7:01 pm - +92 313 2402216: Yes this is imp
03/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +92 313 2402216: Why did u all sign
03/09/2022, 7:02 pm - +92 313 2402216: Are u getting travelling allownce
03/09/2022, 8:18 pm - +92 333 3621839: We get basic salary plus monetary allowance that makes our gross salary.
For the trips we cover, we have to send names to the HR and accounts department and then they add per trip allowance.
03/09/2022, 8:18 pm - +92 333 3621839: It was their condition which applies to all now.
03/09/2022, 8:19 pm - +92 313 2402216: Ok
03/09/2022, 8:19 pm - +92 313 2402216: Complaint and then we will try to do something
03/09/2022, 8:19 pm - +92 333 3621839: Sure. Thank you so much
03/09/2022, 8:23 pm - +92 313 2402216: Welcome
03/09/2022, 8:23 pm - +92 313 2402216: 🥰🥰
03/09/2022, 8:31 pm - +92 336 2292294: @923333621839 💯agree! we are stuck just due to this agreement that we had made, but I still remember that in the interview we were told that this satellite rotation would be just done for an year and then new employees would be hired to the respected satellite NICVD....Jo Aj Tak Na Hoa!! Don't know why they are not employing permanent staff in Sukkur n Larkana NICVD😣 making us to risk our life!
03/09/2022, 8:44 pm - +92 302 9256676: Because no one wants To work there.  Even the People from interior want to be in Karachi.

04/09/2022, 2:45 pm - +92 301 8388028: Message sent by a friend :

Congo Fever has hit Pakistan. The Ticks have come in with the Flood Waters. My sister Shahzia's good friend, Ayesha Ikram contracted it, and died 6 days back. The doctor treating her got infected from her and passed away 3 days ago. The nurse on duty also got Congo Fever and died this morning! Its highly contagious, and there is no cure!! The above three ladies died at the CMH Lahore. The Government of Pakistan is denying it. Don't know why. But please be careful. These were people known to us. I'm sure there are others, in other cities who are dying of it, and their deaths are being put down to Covid, or Covid related illnesses. 
Please wear masks, closed shoes, leave your shoes outside your main door. Wash your hands regularly and sanitize them. When coming from outside, whether to your office or home spray your clothes and shoes with a disinfectant spray for ticks. Spray on mouldings, corners, dark areas and window sills etc. Please take this seriously. Its very real. Congo Fever has come to Pakistan. Remember, there is no cure. One can survive Covid, but not Congo Fever. Stay Safe.

08/09/2022, 3:03 pm - +92 321 8050020: Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory focuses on the quality and context of the child’s
environment. He states that as a child develops, the interaction within these environments becomes more complex.
This complexity can arise as the child’s physical and cognitive structures grow and mature. So, given that nature
continues on a given path, how does the world that surrounds the child help or hinder continued development? This
is the question answered by Bronfenbrenner’s theory.
08/09/2022, 3:04 pm - +92 321 8050020: Urie Bronfenbrenner, co-founder of Head Start, uses his bioecological model to provide a startlingly clear view of the
problems we have been seeing in our students and in our families. He says that technology has changed our society,
and while we are taking great pains to safeguard the physical environment from the damage done by a technology, we
have spent no resources to provide similar safeguards to the damage done to our societal environment. (Henderson,
1995). Our economy has shifted from an industrial model to a technological model, yet the patterns of the workplace
have continued to rely on the factory work ethic. Parents are expected to work a schedule that revolves around the
factory whistle – even though they may work in a high tech office. The technology that enables workers to be free of
manual labor, should also free them from the time and place boundary. Yet, our work ethic demands more face time
– not less. As women entered the work force, they too were subject to the same demands. Family life in this country
has taken a back seat to the needs of the workplace.

08/09/2022, 3:49 pm - +92 321 8050020: For the educational community to attempt a primary role is to help our society continue
its denial of the real issue. The problems students and families face are caused by the conflict between the
workplace and family life – not between families and schools. Schools and teachers should work to support the
primary relationship and to create an environment that welcomes and nurtures families. We can do this while we
work to realize Bronfenbrenner’s ideal of the creation of public policy that eases the work/family conflict (Henderson,
1995). It is in the best interest of our entire society to lobby for political and economic policies that support the
importance of parent’s roles in their children’s development. Bronfenbrenner would also agree that we should foster
societal attitudes that value work done on behalf of children at all levels: parents, teachers, extended family,
mentors, work supervisors, legislators.

#Dengue awareness.

Platelet deficiency is not the cause of death in people suffering from Dengue

According to International guidelines, unless a patient’s platelet count is below 10,000, and there is spontaneous, active bleeding, no platelet transfusion is required. The outbreak of dengue in the City and Hospital beds are full and families are seen running around in search of platelets for transfusion. However what most people do not realize is that the first line of treatment for dengue is not platelet transfusion. It, in fact, does more harm than good if used in a patient whose counts are over 10,000.

The primary cause of death in patients suffering from dengue is capillary leakage, which causes blood deficiency in the intravascular compartment, leading to multi-organ failure. At the first instance of plasma leakage from the intravascular compartment to the extravascular compartment, fluid replacement amounting to 20 ml per kg body weight per hour must be administered. This must be continued till the difference between the upper and lower blood pressure is over 40 mmHg, or the patient passes adequate urine. This is all that is required to treat the patient. Giving unnecessary platelet transfusion can make the patient more unwell.

“While treating dengue patients, physicians should remember the ‘Formula of 20' i.e. rise in pulse by more than 20; fall of BP by more than 20; difference between lower and upper BP of less than 20 and presence of more than 20 hemorrhagic spots on the arm after a tourniquet test suggest a high-risk situation and the person needs immediate medical attention.”

Dengue fever is a painful mosquito-borne disease. It is caused by any one of four types of dengue virus, which is transmitted by the bite of an infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Common symptoms of dengue include high fever, runny nose, a mild skin rash, cough, and pain behind the eyes and in the joints. However, some people may develop a red and white patchy skin rash followed by loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, etc. Patients suffering from dengue should seek medical advice, rest and drink plenty of fluids.

Paracetamol can be taken to bring down fever and reduce joint pains. However, aspirin or ibuprofen should not be taken since they can increase the risk of bleeding.

The risk of complications is in less than 1% of dengue cases and, if warning signals are known to the public, all deaths from dengue can be avoided.

DENGUE NS1-Best test is NS1

Cannot be false +ve

Is + from day 1 to 7 ideally.

If on day 1 is -ve, repeat it next day.

Always ask for ELISA based NS1 tests as card tests are misleading.

Value of IgG & IgM dengue-

In a pt with reduced platelets and looking "sick" on day 3 or 4 of illness, a very high titre of IgG with borderline rise in IgM signifies secondary dengue. These pts are more prone to complications.

In primary dengue IgG becomes + at end of 7 days, while IgM is + after day 4.

Immature Platelet fraction/IPF

A very useful test in Dengue for pts with thrombocytopenia.

If IPF in such a pt is > 10%, despite a pl count of 20, 000 he is out of danger & platelets will rise in 24 hrs

If its 6%, repeat the same next day. Now if IPF has increased to 8% his platelets will certainly increase within 48 hrs.

If its less then 5%, then his bone marrow will not respond for 3-4 days & may be a likely candidate for pl transfusion.

Better to do an IPF even with borderline low platelet count.

A low Mean Platelet volume

or MPV means platelets are functionally inefficient and such patients  need more attention.

10/10/2022, 9:10 am - Dr Farha: This Poem is copied from "wounded butterfly"

I got flowers today.
It wasn't my birthday or any other special day.
We had our first argument last night.
He said a lot of cruel things that really hurt me.
I know he was sorry and didn't mean the things he said.
Because I got flowers today. 

I got flowers today. 
It wasn't our anniversary or any other special day. 
Last night, he threw me into a wall and started to choke me.
It seemed like a nightmare.
I couldn't believe it was real.
I woke up this morning sore and bruised all over.
I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today. 

I got flowers today. 
It wasn't Mother's Day or any other special day. 
Last night, he beat me up again.
It was much worse than all other times.
If I leave him, what will I do? 
How will I take care of my kids? 
What about money? 
I' m afraid of him and scared to leave. 
But I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today. 

I got flowers today. Today was a very special day. 
It was the day of my funeral...
Last night he finally killed me.
He beat me to death. 

If only I had gathered enough courage and strength to leave him, 
If only I had not believed the lies again,
If only I not trusted him 1 last time...
I would not have gotten flowers today.

I respect all those who for their self respect  took one step ahead and broke the chain....

The role requires experience in data analysis and report writing (hence past reports as samples will be requested).

14/11/2022, 11:53 pm - +92 322 2142046: *Request for Help with a Cardio Case* 

There's a 58yr old patient from Badin who has cardiac problem and has been advised bypass surgery. In Badin he has been given an appointment date after 9months. 

Now he's in Karachi and detailed tests have revealed Stage 1 cancer in esophagus as well. 

Now as per doctors, he first needs to get his bypass done inorder to immediately start with his cancer treatment. 

He is unable to get an early appointment at any of visited hospitals in Karachi (NICVD, JINNAH,  KIHD).

Request:  Anyone who can help facilitate with this case in getting an early appointment for his bypass or facilitation in any way.

If required I have all the reports as well- can be shared if needed.

13/01/2023, 8:19 am - +92 321 8050020: What are some worries that bothered you recently? Write down a few of them on your favorite electronic device, or do it the old-fashioned way with pen and paper.

Take a look at the worries you wrote down, and apply this two-part test.

Is there a problem that exists now in the external world around you?

If there is, can you do something to change it now?

If you answered “yes” and “yes” to these questions, then perhaps you should put this book aside and go do something to change the problem now. If there’s a significant problem now in the physical world you inhabit, and you can do something to change it now, go ahead and do that!

If your thought varies in this way, if it changes with your mood, then it doesn’t really indicate a present problem in the external world. It indicates some unhappiness or upset within yourself, in your internal world, that varies over time.

28/01/2023, 12:42 am - +92 321 8050020: Proponents of cognitive restructuring have identified a number of these “errors of thinking” in order to help people identify and change them. These include such errors as:

Overgeneralizing—believing that one bad moment means the whole day is going to be terrible

Mind reading—thinking you can tell what others are thinking, especially about you

Maximizing bad probabilities and Minimizing your ability to adapt to difficulties Fortune telling—thinking you know what the future holds Black and white thinking—thinking of extremes without recognizing the middle ground.

Behind us we have generations that died educating us, putting a national sense into us, spending their assets on us for a well educated, better nation. 
Yahan hum abhi tak apni socio-economic class he behtar nahi kar pa rahay  hain even after putting all our energy and time to grow and stabilize financially AND WE ARE STILL SO NAIVE TO IGNORE how NONE of them is sincere to us.

Look into the population where millions of fathers cry daily not being able to fullfil basic family needs !! 

Its time we stop wasting our time and energy towards such debates - its evident how every single one of them is not sincere to us !

09/04/2023, 5:09 pm - +92 334 7328020: Middle-aged woman had repeated chest and left arm pain mimicking angina, but the cause was neurological 

1. 55-yr old Mrs Akram presented with left-sided chest pain, radiating to left arm for two months. Pain occurred intermittently and it awakened her from sleep. 

2. Mrs Akram was a diabetic and hypertensive (well-controlled) and was a regular morning walker (5 km daily). She had no chest pain during her walks. 
She had occasional tingling sensation and numbness in left arm. She was anxious that she was going to suffer a heart attack.

3. Mrs Akram  consulted a cardiologist, who after clinical examination, ECG, Echocardiogram and TMT, opined that her pain was non-cardiac and referred for Neurologist's opinion. Patient requested coronary angiogram, which was deferred by the Cardiologist

4. I carefully listened to Mrs Akram’s  symptoms, which were suggestive of cervical spondylosis, with pinching of nerves in the neck region. MRI of cervical spine showed disc prolapse at multiple levels, with compression of multiple nerve roots. The diagnosis was confirmed now.

5. I counseled Mrs Akram  about diagnosis & treatment options. She was started on medical treatment & physiotherapy, with which she responded well. At 1-month follow up, her neck & left arm pain had completely resolved. Medicines were stopped & she was advised to continue exercises

6. Take home message
*Pain in left side of chest is often non-cardiac. *Cardiac origin pain is often in the center of chest, which is brought on by exertion (such as walking), and subsides on resting. This pain can radiate to neck & arms. Breathing difficulty may also occur.                         (Please keep in mind that if pain is non cardiac origin, physical therapy is a better option for treatment in such cases. Patient may have cervical radiculopathy, musculoskeletal pain, T4 Syndrome, Teitz Disease, ribs dysfunction etc.)

 _ایک دانشور کی  پاکستانی مُعاشرت سیاست اور قیادت پر سچی اور کھری تحریر۔۔۔_ 

کوئی مانے یا نہ مانے‘ اس ملک میں سب سے بڑا جھوٹا‘ سب سے بڑا چور‘ عام آدمی ھے. جی ہاں عام آدمی..!   جس کی جمع عوام ھے  اور عوام کا واحد ہے *عام آدمی*۔
یہ عام آدمی انتہائی بے شرم‘ بے حیا‘ ڈھیٹ اور بد دیانت ھے۔  یہ عام آدمی سیاست میں ھے نہ اسٹیبلشمنٹ میں!
 یہ نہ بیورو کریٹ ھے ‘ نہ جرنیل!
 مگر یہ سب سے بڑا فرعون ھے۔  یہ اپنے جیسے دوسرے عام لوگوں کا سب سے بڑا دشمن ھے!

یہ پھل بیچتا ھے تو جان بوجھ کر گندے پھل تھیلے میں ڈال دیتا  ھے۔  یہ موٹر سائیکل چلاتا ھے تو پیدل چلنے والوں اور گاڑیاں چلانے والوں کے لیے خدا کا عذاب بنتا ھے۔ یہ ویگن اور بس چلاتا ھے تو ہلاکت کی علامت بن کر چلاتا ھے۔  لوگ دور بھاگتے ہیں!
 یہ ٹریکٹر ٹرالی اور ڈمپر چلاتا ھے تو موت کا فرشتہ بن جاتا ھے۔ ٹریکٹر ٹرالیاں اور ڈمپر‘ بلامبالغہ سینکڑوں گاڑیوں اور ہزاروں انسانوں کو کچل چکے ہیں۔

 یہ سرکاری دفتر میں کلرک بن کر بیٹھتا ھے  تو سانپ کی طرح پھنکارتا ھے اور بِچّھو کی طرح ڈستا ھے۔  
یہ دفتر سے نماز کے لیے جاتا ھے تو واپس نہیں آتا۔ سائل انتظار کر کر کے نامراد ہو کر واپس چلے جاتے ہیں۔ 
آپ کسی ادارے میں چلے جائیے‘ بورڈ لگا ہو گا ''ڈیڑھ بجے نماز کا وقفہ ھے ‘‘۔ یہ وقفہ کب ختم ہو گا؟ کچھ معلوم نہیں!

 یہ عام آدمی دکاندار ھے تو گاہکوں کو اپنا غلام اور خود کو ہامان سمجھتا ھے ،  صبح جوتے خرید کر شام کو واپس کرنے جائیے، نہیں لے گا۔ واپس کرنا تو دور کی بات ھے تبدیل تک نہیں کرے گا!
 اس کا گاہک بھی عام آدمی ھے۔ وہ دکاندار سے بھی زیادہ فریبی ھے  چیز اچھی خاصی استعمال کرکے واپس یا تبدیل کرنے آئے گا۔ 
ہر شخص جانتا ھے کہ امریکہ وغیرہ میں یہ عام آدمی‘ (جو ہم نے یہاں سے ایکسپورٹ کیا ھے)  دھوکہ دیتا ھے،  مہمان آئیں تو وال مارٹ (وہاں کے سپر سٹور) سے نئے گدے (میٹریس) خریدتا ھے، مہمان چلے جائیں تو جا کر واپس کر آتا ھے (یہ شہادت ثقہ افراد نے دی ھے )۔

یہ عام آدمی گھر کا کوڑا گلی میں پھینکتا ھے۔
 یہ دو کروڑ مکان کی تعمیر پر لگا دیتا ھے مگر پانچ ہزار کی بجری‘ گھر کے سامنے ٹوٹی ہوئی سڑک پر نہیں ڈلوا سکتا۔ 
یہ عام آدمی گھر بناتا ھے تو گلی کا کچھ حصہ گھر میں شامل کر لیتا ھے۔ دکان ڈالتا ھے تو نہ صرف فٹ پاتھ بلکہ آدھی سڑک پر اپنا سامان رکھتا ھے۔
 یہ عام آدمی ناجائز تجاوزات کی شکل میں جو فائدہ اٹھا رہا ھے اس کا حساب لگائیے تو شریفوں اور زرداریوں کی مبینہ چوری سے ہزار گنا بڑی چوری ثابت ہو گی! 

یہ عام آدمی گیس کے محکمے میں ملازم لگتا ھے  تو رشوت لے کر ناجائز‘ چوری چھپے‘ گیس کنکشن دیتا ھے۔ بجلی کے محکمے میں جائے تو گھر بیٹھ کر میٹر ریڈنگ کرتا ھے ٹیلی فون آپریٹر لگے تو فون ہی نہیں اٹھاتا۔ آزما لیجیے۔ آپ کے گردے فیل ہو جائیں گے مگر آپریٹر آپ کی کال نہیں اٹھائے گا۔

یہ عام آدمی ہی ھے جس نے سیاست دانوں کی عادتیں بگاڑی ہیں۔ یہ خوشی سے ان سیاست دانوں کی‘ ان کے بچوں کی‘ ان کے خاندانوں کی غلامی کرتا ھے ۔ یہ ساری زندگی ان کے جلسوں میں دریاں بچھاتا ھے ۔ نعرے لگاتا ھے ۔ ان کی گاڑیوں کے ساتھ دوڑتا ھے۔ ان کی حمایت میں اپنے دوستوں اور رشتہ داروں سے جھگڑتا ھے یہاں تک کہ تعلقات توڑ دیتا ھے مگر اپنی اور اپنے کنبے کی حالتِ زار پر رحم کرتا ھے  نہ سیاست دانوں سے اپنے حقوق مانگتا ھے۔ آپ علی بلال عرف ظلِ شاہ کے عمر رسیدہ‘ بے بس ماں باپ کی حالت پر غور کیجیے۔ تصور کیجیے ان کی راتیں کیسے گزرتی ہوں گی! ان کی باقی ماندہ زندگی ان کے لیے سزا سے کم نہیں۔

 اس خاتون کے بارے میں آپ کا کیا خیال ہے جو مریم نواز کے ساتھ شاید تصویر کھنچوانا چاہتی تھی اور جس کے بارے میں مریم نواز نے کہا تھا کہ اسے پرے کرو۔ اس کی وڈیو بھی وائرل ہوئی تھی۔
 یہ عام آدمی حمزہ شہباز‘  بلاول، مونس الٰہی اور کسی چھوٹے خان کے جلسوں میں بھی دریاں ہی بچھائے گا۔

 غربت نسل در نسل اس کے خاندان میں راج کرے گی۔ مگر یہ فخر سے کہتا رہے گا کہ ہم اتنی نسلوں سے پیپلز پارٹی یا مسلم لیگ یا تحریک انصاف کے لیے کام کر رہے ہیں۔ 
یہی عام آدمی ھے جو سیاست دانوں کے کبیرہ گناہوں کا جواز تراشتا ھے اور ان کی غلطیوں پر غضبناک ہونے کے بجائے ان کا دفاع کرتا ھے ۔

یہ عام آدمی اپنے جیسے عام آدمیوں کو اذیت پہنچاتا ھے۔ بیٹے کی شادی کرے تو لڑکی والوں سے جہیز مانگتا ھے۔ بیٹی کی شادی کرے تو اس کی حوصلہ افزائی کرتا ھے کہ نندوں اور ساس کو چلتا کرے یا ان کے اختیارات چھین لے۔ 

مسجد میں نماز پڑھنا شروع کرتا ھے تو مولوی صاحب کو اپنا ملازم سمجھتا ھے۔
 تجارت کرتا ھے تو کم تولتا ھے۔
کسی کے گھرمیں ملازم ہو تو مالک کے ساتھ مخلص نہیں۔ کسی کو اپنا ملازم رکھے تو اس کے کھانے پینے اور لباس کا خیال نہیں رکھتا۔ 
یہ پیروں‘ فقیروں کے پیچھے بھاگ کر خوار و زبوں ہوتا ہے مگر گھر میں بیٹھے ماں باپ کی خدمت نہیں کرتا۔

یہ ھے وہ عام آدمی جو چاہتا ھے  کہ عمران خان‘ نواز شریف‘ زرداری اور چودھری‘ سب کے سب راتوں رات عمر بن عبد العزیزؒ بن جائیں۔ رات دن ان پر تنقید کرتا ھے۔
 اسے پورا یقین ھے  کہ اس ملک میں اگر کوئی راہِ راست پر ھے تو صرف وہی ھے اور باقی سب کو اصلاح کی ضرورت ھے ۔
 اسے یہ بھی یقین ھے کہ سیاست پر‘ مذہب پر‘ ملکی نظام پر‘ امریکہ پر اس کا کہا حرفِ آخر ھے  وہی بلند ترین اتھارٹی ھے۔
 وہ بہت خلوص سے کہتا اور سمجھتا ھے کہ اگر ملک کو اس کی تجاویز کے مطابق چلایا جائے تو دودھ اور شہد کی نہریں بہنے لگیں گی!

افسوس کہ یہاں ہر عام آدمی ریاست مدینہ کا خواب دیکھتا ہے مگر اس کے لیے خود کو بدلنا نہیں چاہتا۔
 جس دن یہ عام آدمی‘ آدمی سے انسان بن گیا تو مُعاشرے  سے لے کر اقتدار کے ایوانوں تک‘ سب ٹھیک ہو جائے گا۔

Would love to contribute for the well being of these children. As much as heartbreaking this picitre is , at least some are better than none . We know there are way worse situations out there.However If we can touch their lives and do our bit , maybe it will help them on the future
18/05/2023, 11:08 pm - +92 321 8050020: It is heart touching to see your care and wish for help. But i don’t how we could help them. We see such things everyday and is now probably beyond anyone’s reach to help. However, we need a sustainable system that delivers efficiently. And unfortunately, Balochistan has no system whatsoever. We are probably hopeless now.

21/05/2023, 9:39 am - +92 300 8082337: گھر میں فریج رکھنا حرام ہے.

مجھے ایک بار ایران کے ایک گمنام قصبے میں جانے کا اتفاق ہوا‘ یہ اصفہان اور شیراز کے درمیان تھا‘ میں اس کا نام بھول گیا ہوں‘ مجھے وہاں رات گزارنا پڑ گئی‘ میں یہ جان کر حیران رہ گیا پورے قصبے میں فریج نہیں تھا‘ میزبان نے بتایا ہم خوراک کو فریج میں رکھنا گناہ سمجھتے ہیں‘ میں حیران رہ گیا‘ وہ بولا‘ شاہ ایران کے دور میں حکومت عوام کو فریج خریدنے کی ترغیب دیتی تھی‘ قسطوں پر ٹی وی اور فریج مل جاتے تھے‘ پورے شہر نے فریج خرید لیے۔

ہمیں چند دن بعد احساس ہوا ہمارے دل تنگ ہو گئے ہیں‘ ہم نے فالتو کھانا فریجوں میں رکھنا شروع کر دیا ہے‘ لوگ اس سے پہلے اضافی کھانا ضرورت مندوں یا ہمسایوں میں بانٹ دیا کرتے تھے‘ ہم میں سے ہر شخص اپنی ڈش ہمسائے کے گھر بھجواتا تھا اور ہمسائے اپنا کھانا ہمیں دے دیتے تھے‘ فریج نے میزبانی اور محبت کا یہ سلسلہ روک دیا‘ ہمارے امام صاحب نے ایک دن پورے شہر کو اکٹھا کیا اور فریج کو حرام قرار دے دیا‘ حکومت نے بہت زور لگایا لیکن ہم لوگوں نے اپنے فریج بیچ دیے یا پھر اپنے دور دراز کے رشتے داروں کو دے دیے‘ وہ دن ہے اور آج کا دن ہے ہمارے قصبے میں فریج واپس نہیں آیا۔

میں نے پوچھا اس سے کیا فائدہ ہوا؟ وہ ہنس کر بولا ”بہت فائدہ ہوا‘ ہمارے پورے شہر میں کوئی شخص بھوکا نہیں سوتا‘ لوگ پیٹ بھر کرکھانا کھاتے ہیں اور باقی کھانا کسی نہ کسی مسکین‘ حاجت مند یا بھوکے کو دے دیتے ہیں‘ ہم لوگ ہمسایوں میں بھی کھانا بانٹتے ہیں یوں پورے شہر میں کوئی بھوکا نہیں رہتا“

25/05/2023, 11:27 am - +92 324 2308802: Ma’am we cannot attach our picture and address in CV. It could result in biasness 🫣
25/05/2023, 11:46 am - +92 322 2142046: This is a valid concern but considering the country of our residence, and being a part of hiring process for some time - CVs without pictures have a low probability of being shortlisted.
Harsh but a reality. 

Also address is vital since its just a waste of time if people are contacted and they say OH Thats Too Far. 

If you're open to distant areas, mention in your CV so that bias is negated 

What you can and should always skip is your age, marital status and no of kids (if any)
25/05/2023, 11:53 am - +92 333 3848423: Okay  mam
25/05/2023, 12:10 pm - +92 324 2308802: During our communication skills sessions, we were told that atleast you should get a chance to present yourself for an interview. How you look is the first thing they judge you on, then on the basis of your address, they might not shortlist you assuming that you’ll be always late 😄 
I’m not denying your perception, just sharing what I believe.
Lastly, I’ve never attached these two things in my CV ever, never faced any rejections Alhamdulillah even though I have a 5-8 mins walking distance from AKU but while applying, I didn’t mention anything because I believe that everyone should be considered for the position based on their abilities, not their looks or where they live ☺️

05/06/2023, 2:21 pm - Dr Farha: 150 Years From Now....

150 years from now, none of us reading this post today will be alive. 70 percent to 100 percent of everything we are fighting over right now will be totally forgotten. Underline the word, TOTALLY. 

If we go back memory lane to 150 years before us, that will be 1872, none of those that carried the world on their heads then are alive today. Almost all of us reading this will find it difficult to picture anybody's face of that era.

Pause for a while and imagine how some of them betrayed their relatives and sold them as slaves for a piece of mirror. Some k*lled family members just for a piece of land or tubers of yam or cowries or for a pinch of salt. Where is the yam, cowries, mirror, or salt that they were using to brag? It may sound funny to us now, but that is how s*lly we humans are sometimes, especially when it comes to money, power or trying to be relevant.

I remember those days in my secondary school, how some people fought and did so many unimaginable things just to have their names shortlisted among those to be made school Prefects. Ordinary school Prefects o! But today nobody in that school right now remembers that I even schooled there despite my popularity then. Now, imagine what happens after 150 years! 
 
Even when you claim the internet age will preserve your memory, take Michael Jackson as an example. Michael Jackson died in 2009, just 13 years ago. Imagine the influence Michael Jackson had all over the world when he was alive. How many young people of today remember him with awe, that is if they even know him? In 150 years to come, his name, when mentioned, will not ring any bell to a lot of people.

Let us take life easy, nobody will get out of this world alive. . . The land you are fighting and ready to kill for, somebody left that land, the person is dead, rotten, and forgotten. That will also be your fate. In 150 years to come, none of the vehicles or phones we are using today to brag will be relevant. Biko, take life easy!

Let love lead. Let’s be genuinely happy for each other. No malice, no backbiting. No jealousy. No comparison. Life is not a competition. At the end of the day, we will all transit to the other side. It is just a question of who gets there first, but surely we will all go there someday.

10/06/2023, 7:08 pm - +92 315 5444298: I had to intervene here, I have lived in Quetta for 2 years (not quite a long time ago). After living and studying with women there, i can safely say that not only i find them the most beautiful inside out but also the fact, that, they are the most coueageous and  brave women i have ever seen. Secondly, women of Balochistan and Kpk take their mehram men's decision, instructions and demands really seriously.  They literally put their brother, husband and father above everyone else. "Women of Quetta can never do ZULM to their men"
Never !
Period !
Be grateful for the amazing women you have there.

Hope you are not offended.

20/06/2023, 7:34 pm - +92 334 7328020: یونیورسٹی میں لیکچر کے دوران کامیابی کے متعلق پڑھاتے ہوئے، ایک پروفیسر نے، ایک نظریہ بیان کیا، جو شاید اطلاقی سائنس سے متاثر ہے، وہ درج ذیل ہے:

 اگر انگریزی حروف تہجی کی ترتیب درج ذیل ہے:
 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

 ان کی عددی ترتیب حسب ذیل ہے:
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26

 اگر زبان کے ہر حرف کو اس کے حروف تہجی کی ترتیب کی بنیاد پر وزن دیا جائے ، یعنی مثال کے طور پر، پہلے حرف A کا وزن 1 کے برابر ہے، اور آخری حرف Z کا وزن 26 کے برابر ہے، تو:

                                                              
 (H+A+R+D+W+O+R+K) = جاں فِشانی
 8 + 1 + 18 + 4 + 23 + 15 + 18 + 11 = 98%

                                                                        
 (K+N+O+W+L+E+D+G+E ) = علم
 11 + 14 + 15 + 23 + 12 + 5 + 4 + 7 + 5 = 96%
                                                                 
 (L+O+V+E) = محبت
 12 + 15 + 22 + 5 = 54%

                                                                     
 (L+U+C+K) = قسمت 
 12 + 21 + 3 + 11 = 47%

 اس کا مطلب ہے کہ مذکورہ بالا میں سے کوئی بھی ایسا عنصر نہیں ہے جو آپ کو 100% یا من چاہا نتیجہ دے گا۔

تو کیا وہ اکلوتا عنصر پیسہ ہے؟؟؟
 (M+O+N+E+Y) =
 13 + 15 + 14 + 5 + 25 = 72%
 بالکل نہیں!

 شاید قائدانہ صلاحیت ؟
 (L+E+A+D+E+R+S+H+I+P ) =
 12+5+1+4+5+18+19+8+9+16 = 97%
وہ بھی نہیں!!

 ہر مسئلے کا ایک حل ہوتا ہے، بعض اوقات مساوات کو الٹ کرنے سے بھی مسئلے کا حل نکل آتا ہے.

اور اگر ہم ان اعدادوشمار کو بدلنے کی بجائے اپنے رویے اور انداز کو بدل کر دیکھ لیں تو شاید نتائج مختلف ہوں!

 "ATTITUDE" رویہ 

 (A+T+T+I+T+U+D+E) =
 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%

 تو اس عددی کھیل میں ثابت ہوا کہ کامیابی کا بنیادی اور اہم عنصر رویہ ہے.
اگر ہم زندگی کے تئیں اپنے رویے کو بدلیں گے تو تب ہی ہم اپنی زندگی میں حقیقی تبدیلی لانے میں کامیاب ہو سکتے ہیں ۔

ایک بات یاد رکھیں علم مفروضی ہو یا تجرباتی اس میں حتمیت، قطعیت یا کاملیت نہیں ہوتی، اسے ہر لحظہ تغیرات کا سامنا رہتا ہے. نقائص کی نشاندہی ہوتی رہتی ہے، حقائق بدلتے رہتے ہیں، اور بہتر سے بہترین کا سفر جاری رہتا ہے.

07/07/2023, 10:47 pm - +92 334 7328020: وہ تعلیم کے شعبہ سے منسلک تھی آج اپنے طلبہ کو کچھ نیا بتانے کے عزم سے وہ کلاس میں پہنچی۔ ڈائس پر آئی اور بولنا شروع ہوئی۔۔
" ایک تفریحی بحری  جہاز سمندر میں حادثے کا شکار ہو گیا، جہاز پر ایک میاں بیوی کا جوڑا بھی سوار تھا، لائف بوٹ کی طرف جانے کے بعد انہیں احساس ہوا کہ اس میں صرف ایک شخص کی گنجائش باقی ہے۔
  اس وقت اس شخص نے عورت کو اپنے پیچھے دھکیل دیا اور خود لائف بوٹ پر چھلانگ لگا دی۔
   خاتون نے ڈوبتے ہوئے جہاز پر کھڑے ہو کر اپنے شوہر سے ایک جملہ کہا۔
 یہاں استانی نے توقف کیا اور پوچھا، "آپ لوگوں کا کیا خیال ہے کہ وہ کیا بات چلائی تھی؟"
  زیادہ تر طلباء نے پرجوش ہو کر جواب دیا، "میں تم سے نفرت کرتی ہوں! میں اب تک اندھی تھی!"
  اب استانی نے ایک لڑکے کو دیکھا جو اس تمام تر قصے کے دوران خاموش رہا تھا، استانی نے اسے جواب دینے کے لیے کہا اور اس نے جواب دیا، "استانی صاحبہ، مجھے یقین ہے کہ وہ چیخی ہوگی - "ہمارے بچے کا خیال رکھنا!"
  استانی نے حیرانی سے پوچھا کیا تم نے یہ کہانی پہلے سنی  ہوئی ہے؟
  لڑکے نے سر ہلایا، "نہیں، لیکن یہ بات میری ماں نے میرے والد کو بیماری سے مرنے سے پہلے بتائی تھی"۔
  استانی نے افسوس کرتے ہوئے کہا، "جواب صحیح ہے"۔
 تفریحی بحری جہاز ڈوب گیا، وہ شخص بخیریت گھر پہنچ گیا اور اپنی بیٹی کو تن تنہا  ہی پالا۔
  اس شخص کی موت کے کئی سال بعد، ان کی بیٹی کو اپنا سامان صاف کرتے ہوئے والد کی ایک ڈائری ملی۔
  اس ڈائری سے یہ راز آشکار ہوا کہ " جب اس کے والدین تفریحی جہاز پر گئے تھے، تو ماں کو پہلے سے ہی ایک لاعلاج بیماری کی تشخیص کی گئی تھی.
اس نازک لمحے میں، باپ زندہ بچ جانے کے واحد موقع  سے فائدہ اٹھا کر بھاگ نکلا۔
  اس نے اپنی ڈائری میں لکھا تھا، "میری کس قدر تمنا تھی کہ تمہارے ساتھ سمندر کی تہہ میں ڈوب مروں، لیکن اپنی بیٹی کی خاطر میں تمہیں ہمیشہ کے لیے سمندر کی گہرائیوں میں اکیلا رہنے کے لیے چھوڑ آیا ہوں"۔
  کہانی ختم ہوئی، کلاس میں خاموشی چھا گئی۔
-------------------------------------------------------------------
دنیا میں اچھائی اور برائی کا وجود ہے، لیکن ان کے پیچھے بہت سی پچیدگیاں ہیں جن کو سمجھنا مشکل ہے۔
  یہی وجہ ہے کہ ہمیں کبھی بھی صرف سطحی حالات کو دیکھ کر اور دوسروں کو پہلے سمجھے بغیر فیصلہ صادر نہیں کرنا چاہئے۔
  جو لوگ کھانے کا بل ادا کرنا پسند کرتے ہیں، وہ اس لیے نہیں کرتے کہ وہ دولت مند ہیں بلکہ اس لیے کہ وہ دوستی کو پیسے پر ترجیح دیتے ہیں۔
  جو لوگ کام میں پہل کرتے ہیں وہ اس لیے نہیں کرتے کہ وہ بیوقوف ہیں بلکہ اس لیے کہ وہ ذمہ داری کے تصور کو سمجھتے ہیں۔
  جو لوگ جھگڑے کے بعد پہلے معافی مانگتے ہیں وہ اس لیے نہیں کرتے کہ وہ غلط ہیں بلکہ اس لیے کرتے ہیں کہ وہ اپنے اردگرد کے لوگوں کی قدر کرتے ہیں۔
  جو لوگ اکثر آپ کو میسج کرتے ہیں، ایسا اس لیے نہیں کرتے کہ ان کے پاس کرنے کے لیے کچھ بہتر کام نہیں ہے بلکہ اس لیے کہ آپ ان کے دل میں بستے ہیں۔
  ایک دن ہم سب ایک دوسرے سے بچھڑ جائیں گے۔  ہم ہر موضوع اور موقع کے بارے میں گفتگو کو یاد کریں گے۔اور ان خوابوں کو جو ہم نے مل کر دیکھے تھے۔  دن، مہینے، سال گزرتے جائیں گے، یہاں تک کہ یہ رابطے نایاب ہو جائیں گے .. 
ایک دن ہمارے بچے ہماری تصویریں دیکھیں گے اور پوچھیں گے کہ یہ کون لوگ ہیں؟  اور ہم پوشیدہ آنسوؤں کے ساتھ مسکرائیں گے کیونکہ ایک مضبوط لفظ دل کو چھو لیتا ہے اور ہم کہیں گے: " یہ وہی تھے جن کے ساتھ ہم نے اپنی زندگی کے بہترین دن گزارے تھے ". 
انگریزی ادب سے لی گئی کہانی جو ہمارے معاشرے کی بھی بھرپور عکاسی کرتی ہے۔ 
خوش رہیں آباد رہیں اور ایک دوسرے کو میسیج کرتے رہیں

10/09/2023, 11:32 am - +92 300 8082337: لوگ ڈاکٹروں کی بجائے عطائیوں کی بات زیادہ کیوں مانتے ہیں؟؟؟
کیونکہ :-
وہ کبھی بھی ٹیسٹ کروانے کا نہیں کہتے کہ جی علاج سے پہلے تشخیص ضروری ہے، بس جو سمجھ میں آیا دوائی دی ورنہ آخر میں کہہ دیا کہ سرکاری ہسپتال لے آنا پیر والے دن وڈے ڈاکٹر کو دکھا دینگے

کبھی 5، 7، 10، 14 دن کو کورس پورا کرنے کو نہیں کہتے، سو دے آر inexpensive

کوئی بھی مرض لاعلاج نہیں بتاتا، کبھی breaking the bad news والا سین نہیں ہوتا، ہمیشہ مثبت رپورٹنگ، لہذا ہائی ریٹنگ😜

ہمیشہ علاج صلاح، مشبرے نال کردا اے، آپ کا موڈ ڈرپ، ٹیکہ کا ہوتو رائے شامل کر کے آرام سے دیہاڑی لگاتا ہے.

مریض عطائی سے علاج کرتے کرتے مر جائے، تو وہی عطائی سوگواران میں جا کر پاکستانیوں کا ہمیشہ کا جملہ بولتا ہے:
"بس جی جیہڑی رات قبر وچ اے او بار نہیں آنی، نالے میں دسنا سی کہ کل قلاں دے ختم دی روٹی میرے ولوں اے"

A 43 year old male residing in mangopir Karachi originally from Skardu has presented to Imam Clinic with acute abdomen, is admitted in the ICU, and requires emergency surgery (exploratory laparotomy). The patient cannot be shifted to a govt hospital due to his current condition. His neighbours brought him to the hospital, who like him are daily wage earners as well and earn Max Rs.15000 to 18,000 per month. The hospital bill, including post-op ICU stay, is estimated to go up to Rs. 350,000. They have collected a sum of Rs. 80,000 from the nearby manghopir neighbourhood and are trying for more but have major financial constraints. The surgery is already planned, and the hospital itself has extended its support for the patient, but there is still a shortfall of funds by at least Rs. 250,000. This patient needs your help and support. Please donate generously, Zakat is applicable. For further information and to donate, please contact

30/10/2023, 10:20 pm - +92 344 2192596: A woman brought a very limp duck in to a veterinary  surgeon.
As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope
and listened to the duck's chest.

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head
sadly and said, “I’m sorry, your duck Cuddles, has passed away.”

The distressed woman wailed, “Are you sure?”

“Yes, I am sure. The duck is dead,” replied the Vet.

“How can you be so sure?” she protested.
“I mean you haven’t done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.”

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left
the room.

He returned a few minutes later with a *Labrador*.

As the duck’s owner looked on in amazement,
the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it
out of the room.

A few minutes later he returned with a *cat*.
The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, “I’m sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.”

The Vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.

The duck’s owner, still in shock, took the bill. “$1,500!” she cried, “$1,500. $1,500  just to tell me my duck is dead!”

The vet shrugged, *“Well. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $100, but with the "Lab Report " and the "Cat Scan", it’s now $1,500."*

This is *Healthcare* today!

11/11/2023, 5:52 pm - +92 336 8300042: Dear All,
Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health Islamabad has confirmed the detection of Type-1 Wild Poliovirus (WPV1) in the stool specimen of a 31-month-old male child from District
Karachi East (UC Gujro).
The child had an onset of weakness on 15th October 2023.
This is the second Polio case from District Karachi East and the fifth case from Pakistan at large this year. The previous case from the District Karachi East was reported on 3rd October 2023 from the same street of UC Gujro.
Genetic sequencing of the isolated virus is underway.
The technical summary of the case is attached herewith.
The recent Polio vaccination campaign in the district was conducted on 30 October - 5 November. The next campaign (NID) is planned from 27 November - 3 December.

11/11/2023, 5:52 pm - +92 336 8300042: What could be the reason of polio despite immunisation
11/11/2023, 6:00 pm - Dr Farha: Was the child routinely vaccinated?
11/11/2023, 6:00 pm - +92 336 8300042: Yes mam even ipv given
11/11/2023, 6:00 pm - +92 336 8300042: Details mentioned here
11/11/2023, 6:01 pm - +92 336 8300042: Vaccine doesn’t provide 100 % immunity that’s y in my opinion hr bacha hr bar zarori he, what clinicians say only epi dose is sufficient this logic is totally negated here
11/11/2023, 6:24 pm - +92 321 8050020: In my opinion due to heavy load of virus circulation that particular union council has huge immunity gap and even a child fully immunised becomes an AFP for any other reasons will give WPV in stool. Because of the infection in the UC. Also, i believe the lab has detected wild virus in the stool but the paralysis or limb dysfunction will not be there subsequently
11/11/2023, 6:31 pm - +92 313 2402216: No
11/11/2023, 6:31 pm - +92 313 2402216: There is no need of repeated  polio drops only recommended doses are enough
11/11/2023, 6:32 pm - +92 313 2402216: Polio vaccine ki cold chain ke issues hain
11/11/2023, 6:32 pm - +92 336 8300042: No it is not as per WHO, UNicef, cdc and current case is an evident

11/11/2023, 6:34 pm - +92 313 2402216: Coz WHO khud nahi cahta ke pakistan ce polio khatam ho
11/11/2023, 6:34 pm - +92 313 2402216: Wo khud boht bare choor hain

Now can you specify your observations? Because "SAB KUCH HOTA HAY" will not lead us to anywhere unless we don't want to have a constructive discussion.

11/11/2023, 7:38 pm - +92 305 2954389: They had not received vaccine but applied mark on finger
11/11/2023, 7:39 pm - +92 336 8300042: Major issue it is
What about RI status there?
11/11/2023, 7:40 pm - +92 313 2402216: <Media omitted>
11/11/2023, 7:40 pm - +92 321 8050020: Oral polio is not used in countries where without virus circulation. They instead use IPV. US gives four shots i guess but drops are no longer used in countries where polio is eradicated. 
There is a difference between eradication and elimination/controlling. 
You think Sudan was a developed country that eradicated. Or do we believe that India with more than a billion population eradicated because they all were sincere, clean, farishta sifat people. 
Let's take it as a global public health and discuss specific loopholes, bottlenecks (consider Dr.Ozair Sb wali definition here), and see why immunity gap resurfaced after two-three years of successfully controlling the virus in Pakistan despite huge nomadic and high risk population within Pakistan and from-to Afghanistan.
11/11/2023, 7:41 pm - +92 305 2954389: The educated families living in the posh area are highly sensitized for R.I but the people living in slumgs are refusals ..
11/11/2023, 7:42 pm - +92 321 8050020: Yep. This can be possible. There are several reasons behind fake finger marking. But also we need to consider whether the respondent at the family is telling truth or not. Most common reason for FFM is that the family is a refusal house & then forces the frontline worker to fake mark with threatyof consequences. In such cases the statement of a refusal family is not reliable.
11/11/2023, 7:44 pm - +92 321 8050020: This maybe specific case but the dynamics of every area differ. Here the slums who are mostly high risk groups are not vaccine refusals. While the posh areas have some very chronic refusals.
11/11/2023, 7:49 pm - +92 313 2402216: I agree that i saw very educated families refusing vaccines
11/11/2023, 7:54 pm - +92 313 2402216: Not only polio but others as well

So this is the last week for registerations. We'll be having our orientation on coming Saturday insha'Allah. 

Learning the Python language gives you a competitive edge as its the most user friendly and easy to learn coding language that not just enables you to design websites, LLMs but also helps you with data handling. 

Python based data handling, presentations and case reports not now highly preferred by international journals. 

It is definitely a great chance to develop a new skill and enter the world of AI. Specially designed for individuals who have no prior knowledge of CS or AI.

انہوں نے کہا کہ دشمن پاکستانی فوج اپنی شکست اور بزدلی چھپانے کیلئے میڈیا میں جھوٹے دعوے کررہی ہے کہ اس نے بی ایل اے کا حملہ پسپا کردیا ہے اور مچھ شہر کو کلیئر کیا گیا ہے۔ بلوچ سرمچار اس وقت مکمل عوامی حمایت میں مچھ شہر کے گلیوں میں گھوم رہے ہیں۔ ہم عالمی میڈیا بشمول پاکستانی میڈیا کو دعوت دیتے ہیں کہ وہ آئیں اور خود صورتحال کا جائزہ لیں تاکہ حقائق لوگوں کے سامنے افشاں ہوجائیں۔ ہم میڈیا کو مکمل تحفظ کا ضمانت دیتے ہیں۔

In this election there was insufficient staff provided to POs just because the turnover was expected to be high and they wanted to reduce it any how.

11/02/2024, 10:01 am - Dr Farha: Dear all 
It's always heartening to see people raising their opinions on politics...it's an indication that we are still alive 
We need to realise that by condemning the politicians we are wasting our words as those politicians who are still hanging around even after 2 to 3 decades or maybe more are the worst amongst the lot as they are the ones who are front men of establishment fulfilling it's nefarious agenda be it Current PPP, MQM pak or Nawaz league
11/02/2024, 10:02 am - Dr Farha: * or favouring the politicians
11/02/2024, 10:03 am - Dr Farha: IK in 2018 was made PM in a very similar manner we need not to forget but very soon they realised they picked the wrong man
11/02/2024, 10:04 am - Dr Farha: Same happened with Altaf Hussain he was thrown out of the country
11/02/2024, 10:06 am - Dr Farha: Remaining leaders especially Zardari is their ladla...but unfortunately they cannot make Zardari PM as he has no support in Punjab
11/02/2024, 10:08 am - Dr Farha: @923336571330 have you forgotten the chartered plane of Jehangir tareen and the crores spent by tareen and Aleem in buying the independents 🙄

13/02/2024, 6:20 pm - +92 332 0278729: He isn't sitting in opposition...zardari is opting to b president and help nawaz run the govt in coalition
13/02/2024, 6:24 pm - +92 313 8337135: The most vocal, calculated, and oriented politician of the country shouldn't be humiliated in such a way. It's a kind of character assassination. Even his today's highly graceful decision being not a part of PMLN govt cabint is appropriated across the country. Bilawal is doing good so far
13/02/2024, 6:24 pm - +92 313 8337135: Strongly disagree with such content creators and publishers.

13/02/2024, 6:27 pm - +92 333 3403522: I beg to differ with the word MOST here.
13/02/2024, 6:29 pm - +92 313 8337135: Oriented, Voccal and about our economy, interference of Institutions in politics, political differences among political parties, Human Rights, Global Climate Change and many other issues.
13/02/2024, 6:31 pm - +92 333 3403522: Oriented and vocal about our economy? Really? 
Tabhi khi ka budtareen haal hua hai inki hakoomat main? 
The worst conditions sindh has ever seen.

13/02/2024, 6:36 pm - +92 313 8337135: Mam, during the election campaign, Bilawal was the only leader among other political leaders presented party's manifesto and who did an aggressive and comprehensive campaign covering all issues of common man.
13/02/2024, 6:37 pm - +92 313 8337135: No Mam

17/02/2024, 2:33 am - +92 331 2352217: A Syrian national who is a crewmember aboard a cargo ship that is presently at Karachi has suffered a mental episode and become primarily catatonic. CT Scan in AKU revealed nothing out of the ordinary and they discharged him owing to lack of space.

Please recommend a safe, clean and reputable psychiatric ward that he can be admitted into. This is quite urgent. 

For the sake of clarity, the aim is to get him into an appropriate psychiatric ward, a mental asylum. 

He will have to stay in the psychiatric ward for around a week until his brother can arrive from Syria to escort him back to Syria via flight.

My name is Arebah Rana and I want to introduce myself on this group as a humanistic therapist. I am currently under training with CPPD, a local body based in Karachi and affiliated with the British Association for Clinical Psychology. 

I welcome you to contact me if you or a loved one is in search of a therapist. We can work around your requirements and I’d be happy to assist your journey - or help you get in touch with another therapist that better suits your needs.

30/03/2024, 3:39 pm - Dr Farha: Asalamu Alaikum.

I am Dr Faran Farooq,
I personally want your attention to the tragic situation I am facing.

*My daughter Haya Maryam* is just 5 months old, and she has been diagnosed with a very rare genetic disorder known as 
*Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type1*  
that affects her voluntary muscular movements. This may lead to a life-threatening condition due to respiratory distress. Life expectancy is limited to 2 years if treatment is not administered. 

Zolgensma, a gene therapy is the only definitive hope for Haya, but it is not available in pakistan.
Globally, the cost of that drug is 2.1 million dollars. Also, this drug has to be administrated before the age of 2 years the more earlier more effective it would be.

I am in need of your help in raising funds for the treatment of my daughter. I already started an organized fundraising campaign, "Hope for Haya "

Please help us to keep our hopes alive.
30/03/2024, 3:39 pm - Dr Farha: How you can Help ?
 1) Remember us in your prayers.
2) Whatever Funds you can arrange by yourself.
3) Must Spread the word with your potential contacts and organizations.
30/03/2024, 3:39 pm - Dr Farha: Following are the details for the funding campaign!

05/05/2024, 9:46 pm - Dr Farha: *CASH begging to be stopped from today*

*Beggar's Free Pakistan Movement initiated by Overseas Pakistanis 🇵🇰

*Now it's a national movement and spreading fast to the whole nation.*

*Give beggars (food + water+clothes). But not a single rupee to give in cash.*

*A different movement has started in Karachi & Hyderabad, be it any kind of beggar.*
*This movement is right.*

*If any kind of person (female / male / old / Disabled / children) is begging, we will give (food + water) instead of money, but from today they will not beg for money*

*As a result, at the international / national / state level, gangs of 'beggars' will break up and then child abduction will stop on its own..*

*Get started Share the post ..*

*Please don't give a single rupee to a beggar.*
*Keep biscuits in the car if you feel like it*
 *But don't pay cash*

*If you agree with this campaign, forward this idea to the your groups.*🙏
